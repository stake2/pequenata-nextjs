So many stories... channeled songs, channeled stories.
I love to make stories, this is a story, about someone that loves to write stories.
I'm Izaque Sanvezzo, stake2, Funkysnipa Cat, or TheColdLakeAppears, I love to make stories, and this is my story.

Izaque was a kid in 2016, he was sat at his computer, searching for new texts on Pastebin.com, he saw a text named "<a href="https://pastebin.com/P9wpbnsA"  class="w3-text-white">P9wpbnsA</a>" and started to read it.
It was the first story that he read, and that he loved, it started with one sentence, ">year 2035".
Then, Izaque called that story "<a href="https://pastebin.com/P9wpbnsA" class="w3-text-white">The Year 2035</a>", it had this greentext writing style that was born on 4chan, where you used the ">" symbol on every beginning of a line and the website would make it green.
Izaque loved futuristic stories and technology.

In the story "The Year 2035" was written:
>the year 2035
>december
>some drugs were being manufactured with different purposes
>strangers
>reports of people ingesting some types of drugs and becoming more aggressive, bloodthirsty, and psychotic were increasingly common
>the military force some times had to be deployed so that no major tragedy happened on the poles of consumption
>it was far worse than that old drug called "bath salts"
>until it culminated
>the people relaxed hoping that the government would give them a solution 
>but this was not the case
>because the government made no effort
>the military themselves were infected
>they had only a special battalion to protect the government
>or who controlled them
>to be expected, the current population of the planet was almost twice as big as it was 7 years ago
>hunger, unemployment, crises
>the world was ending
>or rather, humanity was destroying the world and going along
>at least that was what everyone thought
...

And he thought:
"This story looks awesome, the way the writer tells it and starts it... it is a good way to tell a story... I can imagine every little detail of it, the scene, the lights, the characters.
I want to write an interesting story just like that... with characters that I love... characters that I will create and love... I want to write something, right. now."
Then he slept to rest his mind.
He woke up at 4 PM and his parents were on a trip to a city close to his current city.
He slept well and was well-rested, the boy had a Windows Phone smartphone.
The boy thought that he wanted to write something, and opened an app called MyNotes, which was for taking notes.
He started writing a story, today this story is called "Ilha Deserta" which means "Desert Island".

The story was like:
>It was on... I don't know what day, what year it was
>I was on a desert island
>I was on an island with sand around
>and with a forest of low and slightly separated trees
>it was noon I think...
>since the sun was right in the center of the place where I was
>had made some tools with stone and wood
>an axe, something to make a fire
>and some more things
>and then with the axe I felled two trees
>and I took the woods to take to the place where I was
>which was in a place almost at the end of the forest and starting the sand part
>where some trees that covered the place
>these trees were tilted into almost a shell
>only that the open part was facing the sea
>I put both wood logs on the side of the tree shell
>and there were also some sticks I had taken to make a fire
>I went to get some fruits that I had in a tree nearby
>I picked two apples and some Bananas
>and I went back to the shell that I spoke
>and put the fruits on the side of the two logs I took
>and I sat there
>I looked at the sky and it looked like it was five or six o'clock in the afternoon
>it was getting dark
>I took advantage of the remaining sunlight to get some coconuts
>I got two coconuts
>and I broke both of them in half with a piece of stone that I had
>I used both shells of one to get seawater while I had time
>and then it was quite dark
>I ran back to the shell with the two parts of the coconut with water
>and I sat on the floor wanting to get under the shell so fast it looks like I was in a game I played called don't starve I think
>in this don't starve I remember there was something in the darkness
>that kills the character
>but coming back
>I felt desperate on the ground and some of the water in the coconut fell but I didn't care much
>I sat on the floor and already starting the fire
>when I could call I felt relieved
>I gave a tired sigh and lay right there
>not long after I got up
>and I took the two coconuts that were there and put it on the fire that was still

Then he wrote more and more and wanted to post this story somewhere.
He loved to write that, cause he loved the sea, beaches, and nature, and was also and still is bushcraft and survivalist.
The boy felt so good and happy while writing that story, it was his first story, after all, and he never felt so creative.
He wrote that story while listening to ocean waves hitting on a shore on Youtube, it was an awesome feeling.
The boy was called Izaque, he is writing this story now, on 04/05/2020 at 16:14 PM.
He thinks his story "Desert Island" is a copy of "The Year 2035" because of the use of the ">" symbol and the way he writes the character actions.
So Izaque thinks that he did not have too much originality at that time.

After he wrote a little on Desert Island, he continued to write that story.
One day he was listening to an album on the website called Extreme Music, it was an album about fights, military, war, and stuff.
He felt that those songs were so awesome and so powerful, so badass.
They were good for writing a story.
So Izaque was really inspired by the music, he downloaded the album one and two of the military songs.
Then he started to write a story where aliens had invaded earth and were slaving and killing humans.
The story had laser guns, spaceships, holograms, normal guns, hoverboards.
The main character of the story was called Nyson, Izaque thought that was a really good name.
Izaque named that story "To Be Invincible" or "TBI".

TBI started like this:
And he said while walking:
"I don't know if I will come back... home."

And after that he left the place and started walking with his laser gun, to fight and protect his planet that was being attacked by aliens.

After walking a little, he found a man on a part of the desert with ripped clothes and dirty of sand
He asked the man: 
"What you are doing here?"

And the man answered:
"I live here... you see that hole over there?" he points to a hole on the ground, "It's where I live... it's like a bunker."

The soldier with a laser gun asked the man:
"Oh, I see, a lot of people live in bunkers right?"

Then the man replied:
"Yes, it is the best way to live in this war, or rather... the least worse, also... what is your name?"

The soldier replied:
"I'm Nyson, and you?"

And then the man said:
"I'm John, nice to meet you..."

Nyson that was crouched got up and said while looking to his laser gun:
"Hm... it was cool to meet you too, but I have to fight for my planet, I have to go..."

And then John said while smiling:
"Oh, okay, Mr. Nyson, I hope I see you again."

"Me too," Nyson replied.
