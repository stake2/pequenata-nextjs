There was a tale of brothers called Stakes, they were united and always did things together.
One day, something happened, some brothers disappeared, and the other ones were worried about them.
So they started searching for them.
One brother was called Stake2, another one was called Stake3, they have known each other for years.
They both started searching for their lost brother, Stake1.
Every time Stake2 was in town someone asked him "Where is Stake1?" and he always replied: "I don't know".
