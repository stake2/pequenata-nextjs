22:42 29/09/2017: "And I think yesterday at night I imagined myself in Equestria, I woke up and thought about the kitchen that was in the room at the left, or, because like my bed was facing the wall..."
22:43 29/09/2017: "It was the room in the front, I woke up on the Crystal Castle, or Castle of Friendship, I had left my backpack in the foot of the bed and I went into the kitchen"
22:44 29/09/2017: "And Twilight and Spike were there eating, there was bread, pancakes and coffee, I ate while talking to them, after that I said I was going to read a book"
22:45 29/09/2017: "The library was at the side of the room where Twilight and Spike sleep, I read the story of Ponyville, and Twilight came there to read another book"
22:46 29/09/2017: "We read until it is afternoon, and I marked the page where I stopped and told Twilight that I was going to go out"
22:46 29/09/2017: "Then I came to my room and placed the book on my bookshelf, grabbed my backpack and walked out the door, I flied because I had big white wings"
22:47 29/09/2017: "On the sides of the backpack, they were like angel wings, I came to visit Pinkie Pie, and I asked for fourteen cupcakes, she packed and gave them to me"
22:49 29/09/2017: "I started walking and I told her that the cupcakes were for an afternoon coffee and asked if she wanted to come by"
22:49 29/09/2017: "She said yes and I told her to let Fluttershy and Rarity know, and I said that the afternoon coffee was going to be at 16:00"
22:50 29/09/2017: "She said she was going to tell them and I said goodbye and flew away, I flied to the house of Rainbow Dash that is in the clouds and told her that we were going to eat afternoon coffee at Twilight's house"
22:51 29/09/2017: "At 16:00 and she said she was going to come, and after that I flied to the apple farm of Applejack, and she said she was coming too, I said to her that I wanted an apple"
22:52 29/09/2017: "She kicked a tree and I picked up an apple, I said thanks and flew away, then I came back to the castle door and I said "tadaima" xD"
22:53 29/09/2017: "And came to the library, Twilight was still reading, and I told her that our friends were going to come to the coffee, I said that I brought cupcakes"
22:54 29/09/2017: "And said that I was going to the kitchen to put the cupcakes in the fridge, I came there and stored them, then I thought about going to the room but then I thought I'd set the table"
22:55 29/09/2017: "After that I set the table with magic, putting coffee, the cupcakes, the pancakes, and the bread, then I went to my room wait until 16:00"
22:56 29/09/2017: "Then when it was almost time, I called Twilight and Spike and we sat at the table"
22:56 29/09/2017: "Then the time came but no one came there, then it was 16:01 and Fluttershy came showing up at the dining room door, and then Pinkie Pie showed up"
22:58 29/09/2017: "Then Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack, they sat at the table, and started eating, Twilight sat in front of me"
22:59 29/09/2017: "And Spike on her right, Applejack on Spike's right, Pinkie Pie was at my left, Flutteyshy was at my right, Rainbow Dash was sitting at the right of Fluttershy"
22:59 29/09/2017: "Rarity was at the right of Rainbow Dash"
23:00 29/09/2017: "Twilight asked what Rainbow Dash has been doing, and she said that she was training in Wonderbolts and stuff"
23:01 29/09/2017: "And Twilight asked Fluttershy, she said she was only looking after animals, Twilight asked to Pinkie Pie, she said she was only selling candies"
23:02 29/09/2017: "Then she asked about Applejack, she said that something special happened to her, that a golden apple appeared in her farm, Twilight asked Rarity and she said that she was just making dresses"
23:03 29/09/2017: "Rainbow Dash said she had to go to practice, and Fluttershy said she had to take care of animals, Rainbow Dash left and then Fluttershy"
23:04 29/09/2017: "And then Pinkie Pie said she still had to sell some things and left, then Applejack said she had to farm some apples"
23:05 29/09/2017: "Rarity said she had to make some dresses, and left, and then Spike said he had to read a comic book, then the room was empty, just with me and Twilight"
23:06 29/09/2017: "I was looking into her eyes and she blushed, she asked "What is it?" I laughed and said it was nothing"
23:07 29/09/2017: "And I said that I was going to go to the room to read a little, I was walking to the door and looked back, I stretched out my hand and cleaned the table like it was nothing"
23:11 29/09/2017: "And there was only the plates, talheres(x) and the hood(toalha) on the table, I kind of made a table of wheels with a part of the big table"
23:12 29/09/2017: "And I teleported all the things from the big table to that table, I stacked the plates, the cutlery and the cups and went to my room.
23:13 29/09/2017: "This is like an autonomous robot and it took the things to the kitchen, then it placed everything on top of the sink, it went back to the table where it was and went below the table, removing itself from existence"
23:14 29/09/2017: "it was already night, I went outside, Twilight said that she was going to lock the main door"
23:15 29/09/2017: "And then I said I was going to sleep, she said the same, I went to the room, closed the door and laid down, I thought about those moments that I'm spending here"
23:16 29/09/2017: "How wonderful these moments are, and I slept waiting for tomorrow, the beautiful day I will have *-*"
