It was a Wednesday, Littletato was sat in her computer, listening to some Dubstep in the Vegecloud website, she liked and followed some Dubstep artists, she was listening to the "Fucking Noise" song of the artist "Stratus", she liked that song, Littletato was doing that while she talked with her friends on Vegecord, an app that she had on her computer, the app was made for gamers that wanted to share what they were gaming, she was in a Vegecord server of the site SuperAnimes, that was the site where she watched anime, she wanted to know about the news of the site, Littletato liked to write stories too, she loved to write one specific story of hers, called "Kezzakam", she posted that story in the Veggepad, Yam and Carol liked Kezzakam, they loved to receive a notification of Littletato on Vegebook saying that a new chapter was published, after sometime she closed Vegecloud, she downloaded some songs, Littletato also liked to draw, she wasn't very good, but she had fun, she posted her drawings at Vegiantart, she received a lot of favorites and comments, Littletato also used Vegewitter, she liked to post there but there wasn't much people to read her Vegeweets, but she liked to read other people's Vegeweets, then she turned her computer off and got up to make another thing.

Author's note(Isaac notes): Today was the first day writing Littletato without listening to Indie Folk songs, that was cool, I wrote while listening to some Dubstep on Vegecloud, was good.
