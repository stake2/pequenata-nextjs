Littletato was scrolling in her Vegebook timeline at her computer until something weird happened, she began floating and a light blue light surrounded her body.

Then after some time, she woke up in a beautiful and clean white bed, with a white bed sheet, she looked around and there was no one, just white walls, the bed she was laying in, and a computer screen on a table, after looking a bit more, she realized that she was inside a SpaceShip, there was a huge, blue word on a wall of the spaceship, "LonelyShip" was the word, she sat at the chair close to the computer table and turned on the computer, she thought to herself: "Where am I?, in some kind of spaceship or sci-fi movie?".

The computer turns on and a screen message appears saying:
"Hello, it looks like you are inside a SpaceShip, called the LonelyShip, created by the company ThinkOutsideTheBox or TOTB, you were randomly chosen to live inside here because you have the requisites to live here, this is a supercomputer, which is super fast and has a lot of hard drive space, you can use the Automatic Fridge called Thought Powered Fridge (TPF) to eat..."

"By the fact that you have been randomly chosen, you can choose to go back to your normal life by right-clicking the SpaceLiving tray icon in your computer, click on it and click on [Teleport back to Earth], read the wiki of SpaceLiving or use the Discord invite link to get on the TOTB's Discord server if you need more help, as always, defend yourself from the asteroids, stay safe, take care, and be lonely!".

Littletato was afraid of that, she did not want to leave Julia there, maybe Julia would worry about Littletato's absence, maybe she would be very sad about it and would continue looking for Littletato, Littletato did not want this to happen, she would be sad, but also, she wanted to explore this New World, this spaceship, she wanted to look behind the windows.

She opened MoTable Vegefox which was already installed on her computer and searched for the Wikipedia of SpaceLiving and for the invite link to the TOTB's Discord server, after some time reading, she understood a lot about that world.

Littletato was hungry, she got up and opened the fridge and was surprised because the exact food she wanted to eat was there, a big slice of pepperoni pizza which cheese, the smell was so good, the slice was warm, she wanted so much to eat that pizza, she picked up the plate and laid it on the table, she wanted to watch something while eating, she downloaded an episode of Eromanga Sensei to watch, she was in the middle of that anime.

After eating and watching, Littletato installed the Discord app on her computer and joined the TOTB server, she met a lot of cool people there, there was Izaque, Wendy, Drag, Kendra, Manuh, Ted, Monika, John, and there was a special person there, and that person was called Lisa, the same name of her dog, Littletato was a little sad about thinking about her dog, Lisa, the person at the Discord server, was really cute and gentle, Littletato liked her, she wanted to talk more with her, Littletato took some courage and added her as a friend on Discord.
