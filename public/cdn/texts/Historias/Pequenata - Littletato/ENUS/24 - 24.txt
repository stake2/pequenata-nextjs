Littletato was dreaming of golds, she loved the gold color and the visual of it, there were gold balls, gold ores, gold ingots, everything gold, it was a weird dream, but a good dream.

After some time, the dream changed to something else, there were pink fur balls and a lot of fur things, she liked the sensation of it, there was coffee too, a beautiful land, of coffee and fur, and brown things, that land was beautiful, there were big brown mushrooms like tall trees, and the wind and air there were amazing, you could feel like you were floating in the beautiful, calm and quiet sky, like lying down on cotton candy, or in a cloud, feel the grass touching your skin, feeling the sweet cool breeze touch your body, it was a beautiful sight, it was amazing to be there, Littletato wished she lived there forever, there were also chocolates, big chocolate bars, as high as a skyscraper, there was tons of food, everyone could eat, it was an incredible land, the scent of the delightful and luscious chocolate bars and the mouthwatering and appetizing aroma of the warm lakes of coffee with milk, a lot of people like to bathe and drink in it and it would not get dirty, because it was some type of magical liquid, Littletato loved to live in a giant world like that, chocolate bars fell from the sky unexpectedly, producing huge quakes and bumps on the surface, the food was infinite, there was also candies that were not chocolate, like jujubes, bubble gums, quebra-queixos, big chocolate cakes that fell from the sky, delicious and warm applepies, black chocolate brownies, cheesecakes, a lot of sweet and sugary food, at one time, Littletato was laying on the gentle grass, listening to some Future Bass, some cute and calm songs on her smartphone, she were contemplative and meditative, look at that beautiful land, it made her feel so wondrus and spectacular, so calm and happy, she wanted to stay there forever...
