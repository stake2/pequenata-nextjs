Littletato was looking to the green leaves of the trees, feeling good and happy, she loves nature and trees, Littletato is listening to some Indie Folk songs on her Vegetify app on her smartphone, walking home and feeling the fresh breeze of the afternoon after working all day.

She gets close to home and knocks on the door, Julia opens and welcomes Littletato, then Littletato gets to the kitchen and places the bags she brought from the supermarket on top of the table, they had rice, beans, candies and some spaghetti inside them.

Littletato opened the bags and started making dinner with Julia, they finished preparing it and ate it all, after that, they came to the living room and turned on the TV, Littletato opened the Vegeflix app on the Smart TV and started looking at the catalog for a movie to watch, she chose 'Vegeider-Tableman: Far From San Francisco' to watch.

Littletato left the movie ready to watch and walked to the kitchen to prepare some popcorn for her and Julia to eat, Littletato finished making it and opened a bottle of coke that she had in the fridge, and also some snacks, she grabbed two cups made of glass and brought them to the living room.

She placed both of them in the center table of the living room and came back to the kitchen to bring the coke bottle and the plate with the snacks, and also placed them in the table, Littletato sat in the sofa at the side of Julia, grabbed the TV control and pressed play.

They both started watching the movie, it was good, Julia was eating some of the snacks of the plate while drinking her cup of coke, it was cold and refreshing, Julia felt good watching the movie with Littletato, she was happy, and was eating some of the popcorn too.

In half of the movie, Littletato was feeling hungry again and asked Julia if she could pause the movie, Julia paused and Littletato walked to the kitchen to make two sandwiches for her and Julia, she put ham and cheese in the sandwiches and walked back to the living room with the two plates, she gave one plate to Julia and sat on the sofa, then Julia unpaused the movie and started eating her sandwich while drinking coke, some heroes were fighting in the movie, Littletato wanted Vegeider-Tableman to win, Iron Vegeman was there too, Julia liked him, that part of the movie was so emotional, they thought that the main character would die, but he didn't, they were both surprised.

After some time, the movie ended, it was quite late, Littletato grabbed the plates, cups and the bottle of coke and took them to the kitchen, she washed them and placed them in her cupboard, she walked to the living room and turned off the TV, gave food and water to Lisa, her dog, and walked to her room with Julia, to sleep, they both lied on the bed and covered themselves with the blanket, it was a little cold, they hugged each other and slept.

Littletato was dreaming again, about a field with pink and red flowers, she was sat in a bench with Julia, the trees were swinging and the breeze was fresh and relaxing, she was happy there, Julia was sat in the lap of Littletato, and Littletato was caressing her, Julia's hair was soft and cute, Littletato was happy there, she loved nature, she thought about Izaque and the Indie Folk songs, she loves both of them, she gets so happy thinking of them, she is going to sleep well tonight, say good night to Littletato, Good Night Littletato... &lt;3
