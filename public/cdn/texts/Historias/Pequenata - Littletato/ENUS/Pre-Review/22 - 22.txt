Littletato was alone in her room, she had 11 on that day and was playing some Vegecraft while listening to Xenogenesis of TheFatRat, she loved to listen to that song while playing, she used an app to download the song from Vegetube, she was playing with a friend, Julia, her parents were working, so she stayed at home to take care of the chores, she knew how to make her own food, suddenly she felt hungry, then she minimized the game and let her character stationary, she put to play some Panic At The Disco in her computer while she made coffee, she prepared the coffee and poured it on a cup with milk and made some breads with butter, then she came back to her computer and paused the song that was playing, then she said to Julia that she was going to eat something while watching an anime, Julia said she was going to stay there, farming the farms, Littletato changed to her video player and dropped the "Eromanga Sensei EP1" file on it, she started watching it while tasting her food and drink, after a while she finished watching it, she liked, then Littletato felt a little tired, she waited for her parents to come home, then said to Julia that she was going to sleep, her parents arrived at home, so Littletato turned off her computer and walked to her room and layed on her bed, she slept...

It was a beautiful day, birds were singing, nature was flourishing, Littletato had 22 that day, she was riding her bike through the city, while listening to some folk music on her mobile phone, the sight of a good day on the city, cars passing by, the sun shining high on the sky, she loved to do that, to ride through the city, she also liked to look at the sky, the beautiful blue tone, with the cottons that were the clouds, she had a high roof on her house, so she could look at the stars at night and the clouds at day, whenever she wanted, she loved to do that while listening to her favorite songs, the images on Vegetify, of trees, nature, folk songs, singer-songwriter songs, those were her favorite songs, and her favorite moments, it was a thing that Littletato really loved to do, to see the nature, to contemplate nature, to be passive, to just... look at things, she loved her bicycle, it was an awesome style of life...
