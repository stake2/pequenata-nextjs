Littletato was walking home, she was thinking about that yellow dog from that dream she had, she passed near a pet shop, there were some dogs waiting to be adopted, and there was this specific dog, its fur was yellow, just like that one in Littletato's dream, she loved it, then Littletato entered the pet shop and asked if she could take it, then she filled the paperwork and adopted the dog.

Littletato sent a text message to Julia saying "The dog is coming 🙂".

Julia replied saying: "Oh, I'm so excited! 😊"

Then Littletato started walking back home, with the dog on her torso, she loved it, and the dog loved her, it was female, she called her Lisa, she was so fluffy and cute, she licked Littletato's face.

Littletato arrived home and showed the dog to Julia, she loved the dog and hugged her, Lisa licked the cheek of Julia, they prepared a place for Lisa to sleep and brought food to her, and made a place for Lisa to do her necessities, Julia prepared some coffee with milk and loaves of bread with butter for Littletato, they ate together, both were so happy having Lisa to cheer them up, she ran around the house, wanting to explore everything, the place was so new to her, Littletato thought it was a good idea to adopt a dog, she was so happy at that moment, she hugged Julia and smiled, Julia smiled back.

After some time, Littletato and Julia were tired, they wanted to sleep, Littletato locked the house and prepared herself to sleep, the couple laid in bed and tried to sleep, Littletato dreamed about having a lot of great and happy moments with Julia and Lisa, taking her to the park, hugging her, taking care of her, she loved that dream, because it was real...

(Then the ending of the "No ekisaitinguna seikatsu Littletato [Littletatoのエキサイティングな生活]" (The exciting life of Littletato) anime plays, <br />
Stake2's notes: well, it was really cool to write this chapter, I changed the title, <br />
I actually inserted a title instead of doing just "chapter 1" and 2 and 3, <br />
this way I can remember easily what happened in the chapter instead of saying just "the dreamland chapter" or "the Texas trip chapter", <br />
I wrote this piece listening to SubCarbon Records Soundcloud profile, and... I just wanted to say that to you guys :3, <br />
also, this is how I imagine Littletato (ignore the dogs) <a href="https://static.zerochan.net/Shouin.600.1344153.jpg" class="w3-text-white">https://static.zerochan.net/Shouin.600.1344153.jpg</a>, a really shy girl xD)<br />
