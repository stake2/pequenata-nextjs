Chapter 24

Littletato was dreaming of golds, she loved the gold color and the visual of it, there were gold balls, gold ores, gold ingots, everything gold, it was a weird dream, but a good dream.

After some time, the dream changed to something else, there were pink fur balls and a lot of fur things, she liked the sensation of it, there was coffee too, a beautiful land, of coffee and fur, and brown things, that land was beautiful, there were big brown mushrooms like tall trees, and the wind and air there were amazing, you could feel like you were floating in the beautiful, calm and quiet sky, like lying down on cotton candy, or in a cloud, feel the grass touching your skin, feeling the sweet cool breeze touch your body, it was a beautiful sight, it was amazing to be there, Littletato wished she lived there forever, there were also chocolates, big chocolate bars, as high as a skyscraper, there was tons of food, everyone could eat, it was an incredible land, the scent of the delightful and luscious chocolate bars and the mouthwatering and appetizing aroma of the warm lakes of coffee with milk, a lot of people like to bathe and drink in it and it would not get dirty, because it was some type of magical liquid, Littletato loved to live in a giant world like that, chocolate bars fell from the sky unexpectedly, producing huge quakes and bumps on the surface, the food was infinite, there was also candies that were not chocolate, like jujubes, bubble gums, quebra-queixos, big chocolate cakes that fell from the sky, delicious and warm applepies, black chocolate brownies, cheesecakes, a lot of sweet and sugary food, at one time, Littletato was laying on the gentle grass, listening to some Future Bass, some cute and calm songs on her smartphone, she were contemplative and meditative, look at that beautiful land, it made her feel so wondrus and spectacular, so calm and happy, she wanted to stay there forever...



Chapter 25 - The Dog

Littletato was walking home, she was thinking about that yellow dog from that dream she had, she passed near a pet shop, there were some dogs waiting to be adopted, and there was this specific dog, its fur was yellow, just like that one in Littletato's dream, she loved it, then Littletato entered the pet shop and asked if she could take it, then she filled the paperwork and adopted the dog.

Littletato sent a text message to Julia saying "The dog is coming 🙂".

Julia replied saying: "Oh, I'm so excited! 😊"

Then Littletato started walking back home, with the dog on her torso, she loved it, and the dog loved her, it was female, she called her Lisa, she was so fluffy and cute, she licked Littletato's face.

Littletato arrived home and showed the dog to Julia, she loved the dog and hugged her, Lisa licked the cheek of Julia, they prepared a place for Lisa to sleep and brought food to her, and made a place for Lisa to do her necessities, Julia prepared some coffee with milk and loaves of bread with butter for Littletato, they ate together, both were so happy having Lisa to cheer them up, she ran around the house, wanting to explore everything, the place was so new to her, Littletato thought it was a good idea to adopt a dog, she was so happy at that moment, she hugged Julia and smiled, Julia smiled back.

After some time, Littletato and Julia were tired, they wanted to sleep, Littletato locked the house and prepared herself to sleep, the couple laid in bed and tried to sleep, Littletato dreamed about having a lot of great and happy moments with Julia and Lisa, taking her to the park, hugging her, taking care of her, she loved that dream, because it was real...

(Then the ending of the "No ekisaitinguna seikatsu Littletato [Littletatoのエキサイティングな生活]" (The exciting life of Littletato) anime plays, Stake2's notes: well, it was really cool to write this chapter, I changed the title, I actually inserted a title instead of doing just "chapter 1" and 2 and 3, this way I can remember easily what happened in the chapter instead of saying just "the dreamland chapter" or "the Texas trip chapter", I wrote this piece listening to SubCarbon Records Soundcloud profile, and... I just wanted to say that to you guys :3, also, this is how I imagine Littletato (ignore the dogs) https://static.zerochan.net/Shouin.600.1344153.jpg , a really shy girl xD)



Chapter 26 - PequeLiving, SpaceNata?

Littletato was scrolling in her Vegebook timeline at her computer until something weird happened, she began floating and a light blue light surrounded her body.

Then after some time, she woke up in a beautiful and clean white bed, with a white bed sheet, she looked around and there was no one, just white walls, the bed she was laying in, and a computer screen on a table, after looking a bit more, she realized that she was inside a SpaceShip, there was a huge, blue word on a wall of the spaceship, "LonelyShip" was the word, she sat at the chair close to the computer table and turned on the computer, she thought to herself: "Where am I?, in some kind of spaceship or sci-fi movie?".

The computer turns on and a screen message appears saying:
"Hello, it looks like you are inside a SpaceShip, called the LonelyShip, created by the company ThinkOutsideTheBox or TOTB, you were randomly chosen to live inside here because you have the requisites to live here, this is a supercomputer, which is super fast and has a lot of hard drive space, you can use the Automatic Fridge called ThoughtPoweredFridge(TPF) to eat...".

"By the fact that you have been randomly chosen, you can choose to go back to your normal life by right-clicking the SpaceLiving tray icon in your computer, click on it and click on [Teleport back to Earth], read the wiki of SpaceLiving or use the Discord invite link to get on the TOTB's Discord server if you need more help, as always, defend yourself from the asteroids, stay safe, take care, and be lonely!".

Littletato was afraid of that, she did not want to leave Julia there, maybe Julia would worry about Littletato's absence, maybe she would be very sad about it and would continue looking for Littletato, Littletato did not want this to happen, she would be sad, but also, she wanted to explore this New World, this spaceship, she wanted to look behind the windows.

She opened MoTable Vegefox which was already installed on her computer and searched for the Wikipedia of SpaceLiving and for the invite link to the TOTB's Discord server, after some time reading, she understood a lot about that world.

Littletato was hungry, she got up and opened the fridge and was surprised because the exact food she wanted to eat was there, a big slice of pepperoni pizza which cheese, the smell was so good, the slice was warm, she wanted so much to eat that pizza, she picked up the plate and laid it on the table, she wanted to watch something while eating, she downloaded an episode of Eromanga Sensei to watch, she was in the middle of that anime.

After eating and watching, Littletato installed the Discord app on her computer and joined the TOTB server, she met a lot of cool people there, there was Izaque, Wendy, Drag, Kendra, Manuh, Ted, Monika, John, and there was a special person there, and that person was called Lisa, the same name of her dog, Littletato was a little sad about thinking about her dog, Lisa, the person at the Discord server, was really cute and gentle, Littletato liked her, she wanted to talk more with her, Littletato took some courage and added her as a friend on Discord.

Chapter 27 - Return and discovery

After her trip to a SpaceLiving spaceship, Littletato arrived home safely, it was morning, Julia was worried, she asked where Littletato was, Littletato explained everything to her and told her to not be worried, then Julia brew some coffee for Littletato, they ate together, they also gave food to Lisa, Littletato looked at her dog and thought about Lisa, her friend from SpaceLiving, she had a lot of good times with her and Izaque, she was very happy there, Littletato wished to make another trip to a SpaceLiving spaceship, she told Julia about the trip she made, Julia said she wanted to make a trip to a spaceship just like that, and thought it would be awesome.

Littletato then installed Vegecord on her laptop so she can talk with Lisa, Izaque and other friends from SpaceLiving, unfortunately, her old account wasn't there, she didn't have her friends, Littletato thought that her account only existed in the SpaceLiving world, and she couldn't access it if she wasn't on a spaceship, then she created another account on Vegecord, she joined some servers, Littletato thought about Izaque, she wanted to talk to him again, she tried to remind something about him, some profile on the internet she could talk to him, she remembered about a story Izaque sent to her, Clone Network, she typed the website URL and opened the page, after analyzing and searching a little she found out that Izaque used stake2 on the internet as a nickname, she searched on VegeWattpad for an author called stake2 and she found his profile, she started reading a weird story called "Life of Littletato", it looked like her name written there, she thought to herself:
"It's my name over there?...".

She started reading, it had a picture of a potato at the start of it, she thought that was weird but also funny, she read through the whole thing and started reading the next chapter, Littletato thought about making a comment on it, she created an account to do it, and she commented in the first chapter of the story of stake2 saying:
"Hey... it looks like I'm in this story... that is weird, are you stalking me or something?, I feel observed, like there's a lot of cameras looking at me right now O_O, how did you write this, and why?... and how did you know about all that stuff?".

Then after a few minutes, stake2 replied saying:
"Hey... I am your creator Littletato, I created you in... 05/08/2017 I guess, I created an account here at Wattpad, and I created a story just to test the website, I thought about "potato" and it became you and your story, "Life of Littletato", it has a website too, I created you and your reality, you live in a different universe than mine, I am not the Izaque of the SpaceLiving universe, I'm the Izaque of the Earth universe, I loved to create you, Pequenata/Littletato, you're my creation, and I love you... <3 :3"

Then Littletato worked and ate afternoon breakfast with Julia, after that she opened her laptop and opened the VegeWattpad page, she opened the page of the first chapter of Life of Littletato, she started writing a reply to stake2's comment, to the comment of Izaque, she replied saying:
"Hey Izaque... so you're my creator right?, now I see you as a father... my reality was created by you right?... so I guess I'm happy because of that, thanks for creating me Izaque, thanks for giving life to this story, I love you so much Izaque... thank you, I'm really glad because of that... I love the fact that you gave Julia and Lisa to me, and that experience with SpaceLiving was awesome!, thank you, also, can I have your Discord?, thank you Izaque, I love you, my creator, my father, my Daddy <3 :3, I hope you have a good day or a good night... thank you, I love you <3 :3"

She posted the comment and felt relieved, she was getting a lot of things out of her chest, she watched an anime and turned off her laptop after that, then slept with Julia, awaiting for Izaque's answer, it was a cold night, she hugged Julia tight, and slept a happy night.

...

It was raining in the next morning, Littletato wanted to go to work and she was prepared, she had an umbrella, she woke up, ate breakfast with Julia and said goodbye to her, Julia said goodbye back, Littletato started walking to her job while listening to a Chillstep mixtape on Vegetube, she arrived there while using the umbrella, then she entered the building, closed it and stored it on one of the cabinets of the building, she walked to her desk, sat on the chair and started fixing an app that had bugs, after that, she wanted a coffee break because she was tired, Mia, her coworker was there, Littletato talked with Mia about things like jobs, life, relationships, Mia said she was single, Littletato said she was dating someone, Mia said "Good luck with your partner!" and Littletato said "Thank you!", Mia asked Littletato:
"Can I come to your house someday?".

Littletato replied:
"Sure... when do you want to visit me?"

Mia said:
"Next week maybe? on Friday..."

Littletato replied:
"That sounds like a good day, feel free to come by"

Mia replied:
"Thank you!"

After that, Littletato came back to work and after the job was over, she walked back home and hugged Julia, then ate the afternoon breakfast with her, she gave some food to Lisa too, Littletato was excited to see Izaque's reply, she turned on her laptop and opened VegeWattpad again, a notification appeared saying that Izaque replied to her comment.

Izaque replied saying:
"Hey Littletato, I love you, my daughter, my little blossom :3, I'll send you my Vegecord id on the messages of VegeWattpad okay? <3"

Then Izaque sent his Vegecord id on the inbox of Littletato, she added him and started talking with him, she thanked him for creating her, and he said that he is very proud of creating her, Littletato said to Izaque:
"Thanks, Daddy <3".

After that, Littletato listened to some music and talked to some friends on Vegecord and Vegebook, then she closed her laptop and came to her room to sleep with Julia, she hugged Julia and slept with her.



Chapter 28 - The beautiful Life of Littletato ;heart;

(The beautiful Life of Littletato, with much love, Izaque)
Littletato was dreaming about being a unicorn in the land of Equestria, she was a purple pony who likes books, and she had five friends, one was yellow, another one was blue, the other was pink, another one was white, the last one was orange, she liked all of her friends, and she knew how to do spells, Littletato also had a friend called Spike, who was able to send her messages to a princess that rules Equestria, her name was Celestia.

The name of Littletato in that land was Twilight Sparkle, she was in her crystal castle, reading some books, a book called "The story of the land of Equestria", it was about six ponies who were super friends and liked to have fun together, and about some humans in the planet Earth who liked to watch that cartoon, because that book was the book version of the cartoon that existed on Earth, it talked about anons and humans that watched that show too, one human was called Izaque, he was using his computer to write a story about a potato on the internet, and that chapter was about a specific cartoon being a dream of the character of the potato story, the story of the potato was called tatoLittle, Izaque was so happy to write that, a story that he loves a lot (tatoLittle) and a cartoon that he loves a lot (My Little Pony), Twilight Sparkle(Littletato) was reading that story, she thought it was a pretty good one and she liked the character of Izaque, because it reminded her about her creator, Izaque.

She thinks he is having fun there, creating her story, having fun while writing, she is so thankful to him, because he created her, he gave life to Littletato, and she loves Izaque, she is so happy because of him, and he is so happy because of her.

Then, Littletato, while being Twilight Sparkle, notices that a portal has opened inside her crystal castle, an old friend of her from Earth, Izaque, was inside it, he had beautiful yellow wings of fire and a yellow hand-grappling hook made of lava fluid, he steps out the purple portal and talks with her:

"Hey Twilight Sparkle!, how are you?" he asks.

"I'm good, and you Izaque?" she replies.

"Me too, long time no see right?" he says.

Then Twilight replies: "Yea, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".

Then Izaque told Twilight that he was talking with a friend of him, a friend from a distant place, Izaque was sat in the blue and comfy carpet that Twilight had, she stopped reading her book to listen to him.

"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, you know... I wrote this story in 2016, it was called Littletato too, it was so awesome, and is still so awesome to write that, I felt incredible and happy" explains Izaque.

"Oh... that is very great to hear Izaque!, I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it, 2016 was a long time in Earth right? like... 365 days, you're inspiring me to write a story Izaque!, that makes me soooo happy" replies Twilight.

Then Izaque says: "Yea, a very long time, well... today right now in Earth is the year of 2019, I'm glad you're inspired by me Twilight, that makes me so much happy!, I would love to teach you how to write something!" says him.

"I would love that!, please teach me, Izaque-sensei(teacher)" replies Twilight.

Then Twilight asks: "Soo... how do you spoke with her? was it good?".

"Yes, it was pretty good, well, I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and asked for my Discord id, I gave it to her then she added me, thanked me for everything that I did, even if what I did was just create a story, I'm thankful for meeting her, my creation, haha, that was weird", explains Izaque.

"Oh, that is a pretty good way of meeting someone, even though I don't know what Discord is, is it a network work that Discord created or something?, how can you two connect that way?, sometimes I can't understand Discord, ugh..." says Twilight.

"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of this land, you know, Discord is only the name for a social network that exists on Earth, a technology network where people can talk with each other, I also can't understand him, never..." replies Izaque.

Then Littletato, in the body of Twilight was happy because she was talking with Izaque personally, even if she was a pony from Equestria, she loved that moment, she wished Julia was there with her, then, suddenly, she was Asuna from Japanese animation or anime called Sword Art Online, she was fighting by the side of Kirito, which reminded her of Izaque, and Silica was there too, Littletato(Asuna) thought that Silica reminded her of Julia, so cute and innocent, then she was at Yuru Camp, she was Shimarin, a camping girl, she was sat by the side of Nadeshiko which reminded her of Julia and Chiaki which reminded her of Izaque, suddenly she was in the body of Izaque, it felt weird, being him, he was writing a story called Littletato, he was so happy, Izaque was talking with his friends on Discord, Igor, Duda, CoffeeMedio, Naty Mira, he loved to have company while writing, Littletato thought that that was incredible, feeling all of his emotions and sensations, she loved to be in his place, she wished she was there with him, by him side, talking, chatting, doing things together, she thought she was loving him, but no, she only wanted to be his friend, because he is so incredible to her, he is everything for her, she loved Julia and Izaque very much, she is still dreaming, still thinking, still imaging, she loves her life, she loves to be where she is right now, with her friends, with Izaque, thinking about all the things that she can do, everything that she could do right now, she wants, she wants to live her life so much right now, with all of her dreamings reminding her about what she haves, she loves Izaque very much, Littletato is gonna have a good slept tonight, a reaaally good sleep, and good dreams, (goodnight you too, there, reading this story right now, I don't know who you are, but I probably love you, thank you for reading this!, I love you so much, my reader, and if you're a friend of mine on Discord screenshot this part and send it to me!, thanks for reading, I'm Izaque, I live in 2019 while writing this, goodnight, good dreams, love you!, peace! <3)
