<krrzzzz>
Hello?
Is this thing on?
<krrzzzz>
My name is <Krzzz>
<Krzzz>
Anyway, I don't know what happened...
I don't know how this happened, how the biters... ugh...
<Krzzz>
*sound of someone sitting in a wooden floor*
I'm living on my house.
I think that a lot of people left their houses yesterday.
I don't know where they've gone.
My daughter is living in a city close to here.
I wonder if she is safe... *sigh*
I managed to make a spiked baseball bat with some nails that I had.
*the audible sound of a door being hit by something alive*
Oh, I gotta take care of something, wait a little...
*sound of a head being hit by sharp nails and a groan*
...
*door being shut with a thump*
*footsteps getting close*
Don't worry, it's just, ah... those biters again...
*baseball bat being dropped on the ground making a thump*
What I was talking about?...
Ah, alright, I have some food here, some canned food...
I don't know if <krrrzzz> it will last...
And... I think I'll have to search for some bed sheets, I don't have curtains...
<krrrzzz> I think my battery is running out- <krrrzzz>
Alright, I'll go get some batteries later...
Maybe there's a store close to here where I can get them.
Talk to you soon, stay safe, stay away from the biters...
*sound of a click in the button of some audio device*
*click*
