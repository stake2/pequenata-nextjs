Izaque was on his spaceship, he was on his computer, listening to a song called The Brig - Mind Changer.
He was thinking about Marina, her friend that also lives in a spaceship, he wanted to see her again, even though they had seen each other last night.
Izaque was thinking of calling Lisa to visit his spaceship for a few hours, he opened Discord and talk to her.
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, do you know about the new system of teleport between the SpaceShips?..."
Lisa: "Yes, what's up?"
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think you already know that I visited the spaceship of Marina, right?"
Lisa: "Yea, I know about that, what you're trying to say?"
Funkysnipa Cat: "I want to say is that I want you to visit my spaceship or me to visit yours..."
Lisa: "Oh..."
Lisa: "Well... I think so... I want to visit you..."
Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh... it'll be great... I think..."
Lisa: "Yes... well, Izaque, I'm afraid of something..."
Funkysnipa Cat: "What?..."
Lisa: "Marina already visited your spaceship, and... I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want... did you do something... naughty with her?..."
Funkysnipa Cat: "Of course not... I only watched a movie with her and we ate some things, then she came back to her spaceship, I wouldn't do anything like that with you if you didn't want..."
Lisa: "Hm... ok... can you call me now?... like... do the thing that teleports me there?..."
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm... I'm sorry in advance, but I'm kinda busy now, can it be later?..."
Izaque then looks at the clock of his computer, it says "00:20".
Lisa: "Ah, that's okay, I'm kinda busy here too"
Funkysnipa Cat: "Okay, see you later my bb, love you <3"
Lisa: "Love you Izaque <3, see ya later"
Then Izaque continues using his computer, he watches an episode of Dr. Stone, he loves that anime.
Izaque feels tired, he wants to sleep, Izaque watches an episode of My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic while eating a chocolate cake and drinking a coca-cola.
Then he lies in his bed and closes his eyes, he sleeps, thinking about Marina and Lisa.
Izaque dreams about being a human in Equestria, he is Izaque, a human that has golden wings made of lava fluid, a hand-grappling hook also made of lava fluid.
He is also a half-human half-dragon, he breathes fire and haves lava instead of the normal human gastric acid.
Izaque opens a purple portal and appears inside the Crystal Castle of Twilight Sparkle, she sees him and he sees her, Izaque talks with her:
"Hey Twilight Sparkle!, how are you?" he asks.
"I'm good, and you Izaque?" she replies.
"Me too, long time no see right?" he says.

Then Twilight replies: "Yea, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".

Then Izaque told Twilight that he was talking with a friend of him, a friend from a distant place,
Izaque was sat in the blue and comfy carpet that Twilight had, she stopped reading her book to listen to him.

"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, you know... I wrote this story in 2016, it was called Littletato too,
it was so awesome and is still so awesome to write that, I felt incredible and happy" explains Izaque.

"Oh... that is very great to hear Izaque!, I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it,
2016 was a long time on Earth right? like... 365 days, you're inspiring me to write a story Izaque!, that makes me soooo happy" replies Twilight.

Then Izaque says: "Yea, a very long time, well... today right now in Earth is the year of 2019,
I'm glad you're inspired by me Twilight, that makes me so much happy!, I would love to teach you how to write something!" says him.

"I would love that!, please teach me, Izaque-sensei (teacher)" replies Twilight.

Then Twilight asks: "Soo... how do you spoke with her? was it good?".

"Yes, it was pretty good, well, I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and asked for my Discord id, I gave it to her then she added me,
thanked me for everything that I did, even if what I did was just create a story, I'm thankful for meeting her, my creation, haha, that was weird", explains Izaque.

"Oh, that is a pretty good way of meeting someone, even though I don't know what Discord is, is it a network work that Discord created or something?
how can you two connect that way?, sometimes I can't understand Discord, ugh..." says Twilight.

"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of this land, you know, Discord is only the name for a social network that exists on Earth,
a technology network where people can talk with each other, I also can't understand him, never..." replies Izaque.

Izaque says: "I also love Sword Art Online a lot, it was a anime on Earth that was launched in 2013, it is an anime, and it was my first anime".
Twilight Sparkle replies: "Wow!, I would love to watch it with you, I bet it is really good, I also have things like that, that reminds me of my childhood, oh, the wonderful books that I've read when I was younger",
"It makes me happy just to think, Izaque... never forget the things that make you feel happy... I love you Izaque".
Twilight hugs Izaque, he says:
"I love you too Twilight...".
After some time hugging Izaque says:
"Hey Twilight, I gotta go home, I will visit you again okay?, I love you" after saying that, Izaque kisses the cheek of the purple pony princess.
"I love you too Izaque, see you" after saying that, Twilight kisses the cheek of the winged human-dragon hybrid back.
Izaque creates another purple portal and goes back to Earth, he closes the portal and turns his computer on.
He opens Wattpad and starts writing Littletato, a story that he loves to write a lot, then he thinks about writing SpaceLiving, another good story that he loves.
Izaque thinks about Duda, Marina, Igor, Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, Wendy, MelodyStar, all of his friends, he loves them a lot.
Then he finishes writing the chapter, he names it 28 - The beautiful Life of Littletato <3, he is so proud of writing that chapter because it makes him so happy.
He thinks about his other story, SpaceLiving, he created it with a friend of him, Julia, it now haves 12 chapters, he loves writing it.
The Izaque from the SpaceLiving universe which is the Izaque that is having this dream right now is feeling all of these things.
He is feeling the emotions of the Earth-MLP Izaque, the New World Izaque, the Nazzevo Izaque, the Old World Earth Izaque.
The SpaceLiving Izaque thinks all of that is weird, that dream.
SpaceLiving Izaque feels and sees how it is to be in the skin of Earth Izaque, Earth Izaque is eating a pizza right now, while watching The Walking Dead.
SpaceLiving Izaque wakes up and sits in his bed.
He thinks and associates all of that information, he wonders who is the Earth Izaque, who is the New World Izaque, who is Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, MelodyStar.
Izaque turns on his computer and opens Paint, the program that he uses to make pixel art and drawings even if he doesn't draw very often.
He draws a pixel art of his SpaceShip, after some time he says and finishes it:
<a href="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileHide" width="66%" style="float:left;border-width:5px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a>
<div class="mobileHide"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
<a href="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileShow" width="100%" style="float:left;border-width:5px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a>
Izaque becomes very proud of that drawing, he even shares it with some friends of him on Discord, Marina likes it a lot, Lisa too.
Izaque thinks about that story that he dreamed of, Littletato, he knows that he never wrote it, he only wrote Kezzakam and SpaceLiving, also SpaceLivingXGDS.
He searches for it in Wattpad, he finds out that a user, stake2, wrote Littletato, and Izaque uses that name(stake2) through the entire internet, he thinks that is weird.
Izaque wants to sleep again, he is hungry too, he eats a slice of pizza and drinks coke, he turns off his computer and lies in bed again, trying to rest.
He wants to dream more too, to know about things of other universes, the universe of Earth Izaque, of New World Izaque, of Old World Izaque.
Izaque thinks that the fact that a lot of other Izaques exist is weird.
A visual list with texts appears in his mind, he thinks it is a dream, the list says:
"Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, Old World Izaque, SpaceLiving Izaque, Dreamworld Izaque, Nazzevo Izaque, Kingdom of Arstotzka Izaque, 'A Perfect World' Izaque,
Omnipotent Izaque, Nothingness Izaque, Clone Network Izaque, Ilha Deserta Izaque, Relaxing Sunny Days Izaque, Ascencion To Equestria Izaque".
A weird list with a lot of Izaques, a lot of versions of him, a lot of universes, multi-verse.
Izaque(SL) thought that all of that information was a lot to digest, his head hurts, he thinks he haves to be an omnipotent being to understand that.
He is still dreaming, a good and calm dream appears and he can have a good rest now.
An audio message starts playing on the spaceship of Marina, saying: "Marina, come to me... I've sent this message to you by the universe feature that is called...
"'Personal-brain spaceship connector' I guess, well... my name is Jay, I'm a Raptier, I live inside a planet called 'Osiris' in the same galaxy that you're on right now,
The Milky Way, come with me, my id is Jay#3394, I've left a device in your spaceship for you to travel to my planet, there's a lot of nature here, I think it will be good for you,
You can just visit and can go back to your spaceship whenever you want, don't worry, you won't be in any danger, we're a tribe that searches for humans to know us, 
Because we're so mistreated and discriminated by humans, we need to be equal with humans, we don't wanna fight, please, visit us, thank you, Jay."
Marina reads all of that, then lies on her bed, she sees the hand teleporter in the floor and thinks about going there at Osiris.
She wonders if it will be good for her.
Or if she will be in danger, she sleeps.
