*The message disappears...*
A LonelyShipper was seeing this message, she was in her LonelyShip, the walls of the spaceship had the Navy Blue color,
She had a Bed, ThoughtPoweredFridge, Bathroom, a Computer, Smartphone and PS4, she also had a Musical Keyboard,
She loved to learn and train with the keyboard, she was very good at it, some time she sent a cover of the song "Faded" to a friend,
That friend was called Izaque, Izaque liked the music cover, and said that Wendy had talent,
Wendy was very happy reading that, Wendy also liked to play some games on her computer,
She loved to eat too, because it was easy to eat on a LonelyShip, you just think about the food, open the Fridge and the food will be there,
Izaque liked to write some stories, he would sent the link of a new chapter to Wendy every time he made one,
Wendy liked to read the stories of Izaque, Izaque thought that Wendy was a really good friend, and he liked to talk to her,
They talked using Discord, when Izaque learned that Wendy was a LonelyShipper too, he became happier than before,
Izaque loved his LonelyShip, Wendy too, Izaque loved to listen to some Dubstep in his Ship, blasting it on the speakers,
Izaque also made livestreams on Twitch, showing what he was doing, to his subscribers,
He liked to download songs from SoundCloud, to play games on Steam, to write stories and post on Wattpad, Fanfiction and in the sites that he made by himself,
Wendy liked to listen to some chill music, and to watch videos on Youtube, 
One day Izaque was reading a really good and atmospheric story on the Fimfiction website,
It was about the My Little Pony cartoon and the Don't Starve game together, he recommended the story to Wendy,
He liked so much those two things, and those things together were better than anything,
There was one day where Izaque didn't made a livestream, he watched a movie called The Avengers: Infinite War,
He ate pizzas, hamburgers and lots of coca-cola while watching the two hour movie,
He loved to do that, watch that awesome movie, Izaque added the movie to his watched list on his website called Watch History,
Izaque also used a software on his computer called Foobar2000, which was a Music Player, Izaque had 25Gigabytes of music on his hard drive,
He liked to have a lot of music, and he called himself a Music Hoarder,
Izaque was also a friend of one of the founders of ThinkOutsideTheBox, he liked the new Update they made to the LonelyShips,
The Double-Ship, WallColorChange, ShipInvite, EquipmentChange, he liked all the new changes and new features,
Izaque sure loved to be a LonelyShipper and to live in a LonelyShip,
He even created a Discord Server about it, and talked to a lot of friends on Discord about how to become a LonelyShipper,
Wendy also liked to sleep, and to play some keyboard on her spaceship, she loved to be a LonelyShipper,
Back when she was still in earth, she wanted to live alone, she liked to use the computer and smartphone,
She liked to see the stars, the planets and the earth from her window,
Wendy had some luck too, because no asteroids crossed the way of her spaceship,
Izaque had an asteroid coming in the direction of his spaceship, then the security system activated and a big laser turret appeared in the top of the spaceship,
Destroying the asteroid completely, Izaque wasn't scared by the asteroid, because he knew how the spaceship worked, and knewthat it would protect him,
He loved to study and to learn about the LonelyShips, SpaceLiving and the ThinkOutsideTheBox company,
With the new update 1.3.709, Izaque and Wendy could visit their families, they liked that, to see them again,
Izaque missed his family, he hugged all of them, his sisters, his brother, his father and mother,
He was used to being in earth and to talk to humans, even if he had spent a lot of time inside the LonelyShip,
Izaque asked if someone wanted to live there with him, but no one wanted,
Then he said "See you later" to all of them, he came inside the Teleporter that was in the house of his parents,
And came back to the LonelyShip, a robot female voice greeted him, saying: "Welcome back, Izaque",
Izaque installed that voice using the Desktop App "SpaceLiving ThinkOutsideTheBox",
The spaceship of Izaque already had a lot of good things and good equipment, a good screen, PS4,
Good computer, good internet, he was happy with what he had,
He wanted to talk more with Lisa, Wendy, Igor and other friends he had on Discord,
He wanted to talk more in the "Discord do Cellbit" server,
Izaque was tired, he listened to some Dubstep music on his computer, then watched a small episode of the anime Eromanga Sensei while eating chocolate cookies,
He added the episode to his Watched List and turned off the computer, he laid in his bed and slept.
