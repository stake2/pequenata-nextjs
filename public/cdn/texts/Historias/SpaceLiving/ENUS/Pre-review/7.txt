[In the last chapter, Lisa was not dreaming, she actually teleported to the SpaceShip, it wasn't a dream]<br />
Another day in the SpaceLiving world, a rumor about a group spaceship was circulating, 4 friends who were so close and knew each other so well.<br />
They were teleported to the spaceship together, this rumor was spreading quickly, the users of the LonelyShips were talking a lot about it.<br />
They created theories and groups, fake Discord accounts about it.<br />
There was also a story, created and written by a user on Discord and Wattpad, called stake2.<br />
It was about the actions and the life of that specific group in their LonelyShip.<br />
The name of the group was... Gang Da Suruba.<br />
Some people thought that stake2 was a resident on the spaceship of Gang Da Suruba(GDS) because the story had many details.<br />
At some time, in 2019 or 2020, I think.<br />
4 friends sent messages in the official SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
Their names were Drag, Manuh, Funkysnipa Cat and kendrinhah.<br />
One of the members sent a selfie of the group, it was Manuh.<br />
Manuh and Drag were fighting in the back of the picture.<br />
Kendra was taking the picture and Funkysnipa Cat was just headbanging to dubstep in the bed.<br />
The users that were looking at the chat started to talk about it.<br />
One said: "They are the rare group that was teleported to a LonelyShip!".<br />
John was there too, he said: "Oh, I would like to live in a spaceship with my friends".<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said: "And that is me, headbanging to dubstep in the bed".<br />
Drag said: "I'm fighting in the back of the pic with Manuh".<br />
kendrinhah said: "And I'm taking the pic".<br />
A random user said: "This is the first pic of a spaceship, we never saw a picture of a LonelyShip".<br />
Ted said: "Yea, that's right, someone gotta tell ThinkOutsideTheBox".<br />
A SpaceLiving Admin said: "They already know about that, since they have enabled that feature, only for that specific group,<br />
So they should feel special".<br />
Ted said: "Oh, okay then, they should feel happy".<br />
The Admin said: "Yea...".<br />
After some time people stopped talking about them, a member of the group began to stream on Twitch.<br />
Showing his things, how he wrote stories, and surprisingly, Funkysnipa Cat was also stake2.<br />
And the story was real, the story was about the group of Gang Da Suruba.<br />
The people watching asked a lot of questions to stake2, what was his name, he replied that his name was Izaque.<br />
Manuh, Drag, and Kendra entered the room of Izaque, one at a time, to present themselves for Izaque's viewers.<br />
After a while Izaque closed the live stream, he wanted to sleep a little, he closed the door and laid on his bed.<br />
Kendra was sleeping too, Izaque dreamed a little, thinking that he loved to live there with his friends.<br />
On the next day, Izaque woke up and opened his door, he turned on his computer and saw an announcement on the Official SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
It was a notification saying that on that day, at 18:00 all LonelyShippers or LonelyShip residents were going to be teleported to a big SpaceShip.<br />
To make a party, also because of that specific event (the GDS group), for the LonelyShippers to know other LonelyShippers.<br />
Izaque told Drag, Kendra, and Manuh about that, Manuh said in Brazilian Portuguese:<br />
"Mas eles não podem simplesmente nos teleportar pra lá, e se alguém não quiser ir?".<br />
("But they can't just simply teleport us to there, and if there's someone who doesn't want to go?").<br />
Izaque said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Bom... eles fizeram isso pra nós trazer pra cá kk".<br />
("Well... they made that to bring us here xD").<br />
Manuh replied: "Até que faz sentido" ("Well that makes sense").<br />
After some time, it was 18:00, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks, they suddenly were floating, then all of them appeared on a single spaceship.<br />
Everyone looked at each other, Ted was close to Monika, John smiled at Lisa and Lisa smiled back, Izaque hugged Lisa and Lisa accepted the hug.<br />
Kendra was a little jealous because of that, Izaque then smiled at Wendy and Wendy smiled back.<br />
Manuh told Kendra that if she was her, she would get mad at Wendy and Lisa.<br />
Kendra thought she was not that angry or wasn't so extreme as Manuh.<br />
Izaque talked a little with Lisa, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, he loved to talk face to face with people he talked through the internet.<br />
Wendy and Lisa were so happy about that, everyone was chatting, it was an awesome sight, a lot of people with lots of stuff in common.<br />
Talking a lot and being in the same environment.<br />
Then a screen appeared in the spaceship, saying:<br />
<i>"This was a meeting planned for some days in the future, but it has been done today because we felt like doing it today.<br />
We, at ThinkOutsideTheBox, want to thank all of you, and we want to say that we are so happy to have you here today.<br />
Everyone who participated, everyone who lives inside a LonelyShip, everyone that lives inside a DoubleLonelyShip.<br />
And some specific people... that live inside a... Group SpaceShip :), everyone is important.<br />
And to know that we created those things, those spaceships called LonelyShips, to make people happy.<br />
To make a good thing, the spaceships are lonely, but you're all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people and making friends.<br />
We are also commemorating here, commemorating... 2 years of the SpaceLiving Network, we are so happy to see all of your faces.<br />
And we are happy knowing that we made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, we are happy to give life to your thoughts.<br />
We are happy and proud to make your wishes a reality, and to provide the possibility of living how you want.<br />
We are so happy to write, to live and to create things for the people that want them, so, thank you all.<br />
Everyone who read the story too, Izaque, or stake2 or Funkysnipa Cat, you're a good guy, and a smart guy.<br />
Thanks for being in our LonelyShip and thanks for being yourself and thanks for existing, xD.<br />
Thanks for everything, and we will continue to live like this, and the SpaceShips will continue to exist.<br />
Also... protect yourself from the asteroids, dubstep is good, and be lonely! (well that's a weird thing to say after what happened today)".</i><br />
The screen disappears, a button to teleport back to your SpaceShip appears, Izaque, Wendy and Lisa keep talking there.<br />
Kendra, Drag, Ted, Monika, and John teleport back to their spaceships.<br />
"Não demora muito Stake" (Don't take too long Stake), says Manuh, who teleports back to her spaceship.<br />
After some time, Lisa teleports back to her spaceship, Izaque, and Wendy talks a little about the anniversary.<br />
"It was good right?", says Wendy.<br />
"Yea, it was pretty awesome, seeing everyone and stuff", says Izaque.<br />
They both teleport back to their spaceships.<br />
Izaque was a little tired, he watched an episode of the second season of One Punch Man and laid on his bed.<br />
He slept.<br />
Wendy was practicing on her keyboard, she thought she learned a lot since the last time she played.<br />
Manuh was sleeping already, Kendra was sleeping too, she was dreaming about No Man's Sky or a Synthwave world.<br />
Drag was listening to some kpop on his smartphone.<br />
Lisa was writing a little, The Odds Of Nature again ("She loves to write that story", says the *Writer*).<br />
Ted and Monika were watching a romance movie, they loved to watch it together.<br />
John was finishing the newest chapter of one of his stories [Me too, ah, stop breaking the fourth wall...].<br />
Everyone was happy in the SpaceLiving Network, living their lives, doing their stuff, doing what they love.<br />
It was a good day for SpaceLiving.<br />
