In the year of 2019, there was a tale of a spaceship that had an entire house inside it.<br />
That spaceship had a fridge and a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl that melts the things inside it.<br />
And people who got those spaceships were people that just liked to stay in their rooms.<br />
Alone and doing things like using the computer and playing video games.<br />
A lot of those people that had spaceships were teens, they were alone and depressive.<br />
By some reason, they were teleported to those spaceships.<br />
One of those people was Lisa, a girl of 16 years old.<br />
She played games, used the fridge for eating, wrote stories on her computer.<br />
She lived there, lived her life there doing the stuff she loved to.<br />
She woke up, Lisa had a beautiful room in her spaceship.<br />
A room with pink colors, a computer, a PlayStation 4, a fridge, a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl.<br />
A bed and a Nintendo 3DS.<br />
She loved to stay there, to write stories, to play games and listen to some dubstep and Japanese songs on her computer.<br />
Today she had nothing to do, but she wanted to play some games.<br />
She turned her computer on and sat on the chair, she then opened Steam and waited for it to open.<br />
She opened Titanfall 2 to play a little.<br />
She loved that game, she entered a multi-player match.<br />
She made a 10/3, she liked that match.<br />
Then she closed Steam and opened Firefox and Spotify.<br />
She selected a Dubstep song to blast on her speakers.<br />
Then she opened Facebook to talk with her friends.<br />
She talked with her friend Anny.<br />
"How are you, Anny?", said Lisa.<br />
"I'm good, and you?", said Anny.<br />
"I'm good too, what are you doing right now?", said Lisa.<br />
"Playing God of War in my PS4", said Anny.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, I'm gonna make something else right now", said Lisa.<br />
"Ok", said Anny.<br />
Then Lisa turned her PS4 on and grabbed the controller.<br />
She also opened her Music player on her computer which was named Foobar and closed Spotify.<br />
She had lots of GBs of music, she liked to have such a big library.<br />
Then Lisa opened GTA V and started playing, she played the online mode.<br />
She was playing with her friends, also she was listening to the song "Geoxor - Turn Around" in her music player.<br />
She liked that song, Lisa had two monitors, one for the computer and one for the PS4.<br />
Lisa noticed she was hungry, she became afk in the game and placed her controller in the desk.<br />
She got up and opened the fridge, it was an automatic fridge that brought anything the person wants.<br />
You could think of a pizza and a pizza would appear inside the fridge.<br />
Then Lisa grabbed the cup of chocolate milk that was in the fridge.<br />
And also the hamburger, she sat at her desk.<br />
Lisa also liked to watch movies.<br />
And series, anime, cartoons.<br />
She downloads that stuff with utorrent.<br />
After some time playing, she said to her friends that she was going to do another thing.<br />
She liked Marvel and its movies, she had downloaded "The Avengers: Infinite War".<br />
She grabbed a bowl of Doritos and a bottle of Coca-cola to watch the movie.<br />
She opened her video player that was called VLC Media Player.<br />
Lisa opened the mkv file of Infinite War in the video player.<br />
And then she watched the movie, she loved the movie, all the action, and stuff, the heroes.<br />
Then after some time, she got tired and turned her computer and PS4 off.<br />
Her body was tired, she laid in her bed and slept, she had a dream.<br />
Where she was going to school, and also had to clean her room and house of her parents.<br />
Lisa also had to work, for her that dream was a nightmare.<br />
Then after some time, that dream disappeared and another dream took its place, a better dream.<br />
She was dreaming of being in her computer listening to dubstep songs and talking to her friends on Discord.<br />
She liked that dream and wanted to wake up just to use Discord and talk to her friends.<br />
Lisa liked what she had, that spaceship, the bed, computer, PS4, and Nintendo 3DS.<br />
She wanted to play, to watch, to write and to talk.<br />
She wanted to be alone, and to have her things to do.<br />
And that is her life.<br />
