(This is the explanation of a... let me create a cool name for that... a "SpaceLivingTeleportExperience")<br />
It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world, even if there's no sun close to the spaceships.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted and Monika were all inside their spaceships, living happy and using the computer.<br />
Lisa was drawing a little while watching an anime called "Eromanga Sensei", she felt inspired by that, because it had an girl that drew too.<br />
She was happy drawing while watching her favorite anime, it was funny, cute, happy, she loved it.<br />
The anime tell the story of a little sister that draw erotic drawings, and an older brother that write stories and light novels.<br />
Lisa loved to watch that anime, she was re watching it for the twenty-third time.<br />
She had it download in HD on her computer, just to watch again and again.<br />
The anime reminded her of her older brother, she loved him very much.<br />
But then she got depressed, sad and just wanted to stay in her room, he was sad about that.<br />
She was hungry all day, but didn't had the motivation to eat.<br />
She just stayed on her room, the lights were dimmed out, she was doing things at her computer.<br />
Then she reached a point in her life that she was weak and skinny, she realized that her life was bad.<br />
Lisa wanted to get out of there, she was afraid, she wanted to go to school just to make her parents happy.<br />
Her family was sad about her, she wanted to get out of there, when she slept, was 05:12 in the morning.<br />
She was sleeping in her bed, she had a dream, a dream where she got teleported to a spaceship that had white walls.<br />
A Computer, PS4, a Fridge that creates any food you think about, a bed, a wardrobe, a smartphone on the table.<br />
She thought that was incredible and awesome, to have all the things you need to use the computer.<br />
To have food and water when you want, and to have a super-good computer.<br />
She wanted to stay there forever, her eyes were shining bright.<br />
Everything was new to her, she got closer to the table and turned the computer on by pressing the button on the computer cabinet.<br />
It loaded Windows 10, it was as if she had formatted the computer, she typed the name of the user.<br />
A password, and then the Windows 10 home screen appeared, it had Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Windows Explorer and the SpaceLiving Desktop App installed.<br />
She opened Firefox, the home page was DuckDuckGo, the favorites of the browser were: DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud, SuperAnimes, Wattpad, MyAnimeList.<br />
She opened YouTube and logged in her account.<br />
Then Lisa opened DuckDuckGo and download Youtube-DLG, it was an app that she used in her personal computer.<br />
The computer also had Steam installed, Lisa logged in her Steam account.<br />
She opened Windows Explorer, she saw that the computer had 5 SSDs, each one with 10TB of space.<br />
Her eyes shined bright seeing that, because she only had 500GB of HD in her computer.<br />
She switched to Steam and told her to download all the games she had.<br />
Then Lisa opened the Mega website, she logged into her account and downloaded the app, she installed it and put it to download all of her 2TB of files.<br />
She was loving that, setting up and organizing her new space of work.<br />
After letting Steam and Mega do their jobs, Lisa was a little hungry, she got closer to the fridge, and a screen that was attached to it lighted up.<br />
It showed a lot of text, like if it was a tutorial on how to use the fridge, Lisa thought it was pretty intuitive.<br />
She learned how to use the fridge, she thought about pizza, then opened the fridge, and a slice of pizza was there.<br />
Lisa thought it was amazing, she closed the fridge, thought about a coca-cola and opened the fridge.<br />
A can of coca cola was there, she grabbed it and closed the fridge.<br />
She came back to the computer table and laid the pizza and can in the top of the table.<br />
Lisa started organizing her Mega files, she liked to make websites, she had a website were she made a history of what she watched.<br />
She downloaded some anime on a website called SuperAnimes, Lisa had downloaded the first episode of the anime "Eromanga Sensei".<br />
Lisa thought it was interesting, and wanted to give it a try.<br />
She started watching it while eating the pizza and drinking the coca cola, she loved doing that.<br />
Lisa added the episode to her watch history and to her AniCartoMovie.txt file, she cleaned her hands and her mouth.<br />
Then she realized she forgot something, "Discord!, I forgot it", she thought, Lisa downloaded Discord and logged in her account.<br />
She was so happy to download it again, and use it again, she thought that was a dream.<br />
Lisa knew that Google+ was going to die soon, she was sad about that, but she was happy about starting that new but not so new life of hers.<br />
She had a special friend on Google+, that friend was called Funkysnipa Cat or Izaque in real life.<br />
She loved to talk with that friend, she opened Hangouts and asked for his Discord name and id.<br />
Izaque gave it to her, she added him on Discord and they started talking, Lisa wanted to know him more.<br />
They talked a lot, and knew a lot more about each other, Lisa was happy talking with Izaque.<br />
Lisa wanted to express herself better, and write something, she wanted to write words in her computer.<br />
Then she talked with Izaque about that, Izaque suggested for Lisa to start writing stories.<br />
She liked the idea, Izaque said for Lisa to download Notepad++, he said that its a good program for writing.<br />
Lisa downloaded the program and started her first draft of a story, she wrote for some minutes.<br />
She liked the result, then saved the file and sent it to her Mega cloud.<br />
Izaque said for her to post her story on Wattpad, because it was a good platform for writers.<br />
Lisa created an account there and posted her story, the name of the story was "The Odds of Nature".<br />
After waiting some time Lisa reloaded the page and there were 10 views in it, and a comment.<br />
The author of the comment was "stake2", Lisa switched to Discord and asked if Izaque had a Wattpad account.<br />
Izaque said yes, Lisa came back to Firefox to read the comment, stake2 was complimenting the story of Lisa, she was happy about that.<br />
She liked the comment and replied thanking stake2, she was really happy about that comment.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Discord and asked for the link of the account of Izaque on Wattpad.<br />
Izaque sent the link to Lisa, surprisingly was stake2, Lisa was really happy about that.<br />
She switched to Discord to thank Izaque for that, Lisa said she loved to write the first chapter.<br />
Izaque said: "I started like that, well, I wrote Ilha Deserta, I wasn't really happy about that story, it was my first story."<br />
Then Izaque said: "I made Ilha Deserta in 2016, when I was reading a really cool futuristic story, I was happy about the feeling that writing gave me,<br />
then I never stopped till today."<br />
Lisa said: "Oh, I'm happy to know that, I love to write, I will read your story called "Life of Littletato", I liked to know how your started writing,<br />
thanks for teaching me a lot about writing."<br />
Then Izaque said: "I don't know much, but thanks for listening, learning and saying that my knowledge was helpful :), hehe, I like you a lot Lisa :3."<br />
Lisa said: "I like you a lot too Izaque, hehe :3."<br />
Then Steam finished downloading all the games of Lisa, she wanted to play one, she opened Grand Theft Auto 5 to play a little.<br />
She had some mods installed, she loved to play that game, to drive cars and stuff.<br />
Lisa played a little and stopped, she closed the game, she was hungry again, she got up and thought about a hamburger and a coca cola.<br />
She opened the fridge and there was, a hamburger in a plate and a can of coca cola. <br />
Lisa downloaded an episode of the sixth season of the series "The Walking Dead", she waited for it to be downloaded and opened it in VLC Media Player.<br />
She thought was weird to eat while watching that series, but she couldn't handle her hunger, so she watched while eating.<br />
It was sad to watch that series, sometimes people die, and you end the episode being sad.<br />
She finished watching and eating, she added the episode to her watch history.<br />
She felt tired, and she wanted to use the bathroom, she used it and came to her bed, she laid on her bed and tried to close her eyes.<br />
Lisa thought: "This is really a dream?, it looks very real...", then Lisa tries to pinch herself.<br />
She didn't woke up, she was surprised by that.<br />
Then Lisa slept, waiting to go more at the computer.<br />
