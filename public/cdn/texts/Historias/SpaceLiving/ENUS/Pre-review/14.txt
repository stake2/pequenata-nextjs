<b>Title: The Visit of Lisa</b><br /><br />
(Words: 3,095)<br />
Lisa was on her spaceship laid on her bed, listening to a song on her computer, it was called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/teminite/teminite-rattlesnake" class="w3-text-white">Teminite & Evilwave - [Uprising #07] Rattlesnake</a>.<br />
She loved that song, it was Dubstep but felt cool and energetic like rock and metal, she liked Teminite a lot, she even had him in her computer's music library.<br />
The gray-haired girl looked through the window and imagined how it was to live there, in Earth, she wanted to come back and she had her teleporter to do that, but she was afraid and unsure.<br />
"What would be out there?", "What I have to do?", "Will I be in danger there?", those were the kind of questions that popped in her mind.<br />
She got off the bed, paused the music and opened Discord.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat (stake2, Izaque) was online, she wanted to talk with him and clicked on his chat, then began typing.<br />
Lisa: "Hey Izaque... do you ever thought about coming back to Earth?".<br />
Izaque: "Yes... actually a lot of times... but... I came back to Earth a lot of times, so I'm used to it, SpaceLiving is connected with the New World, so I have things of the New World to do".<br />
Lisa: "Oh, that's good I guess... sounds like you have a lot of fun outside of the spaceship right?".<br />
Izaque: "Yea, a lot, but I have fun here too, talking to SpaceLivers/LonelyShippers, I love to be inside this spaceship right now, hm... why are you asking me that, Lisa?".<br />
Lisa: "It's that I want to go back to Earth... but I'm scared that I'm not gonna fit in... like... I don't know how to talk to people personally, and I'm not sure if my old house will accept my teleport request...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh... well... hm... we never met personally... right?... I mean... both of us inside the same spaceship...".<br />
Lisa: "Yea... I would like to meet you personally...".<br />
Izaque: "Me too... but... you said you were afraid of... coming here in my spaceship... like... you said 'I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want'...".<br />
Lisa: "Hm... yes... I'm a little afraid of that... sorry... it's nothing about you and I'm not afraid of you... don't worry... I love you, Izaque <3".<br />
Izaque: "Oh... I know, I love you too, Lisa <3, and I'm happy that you're not afraid of me... do you want to make a deal?".<br />
Lisa: "What deal?".<br />
Izaque: "Hm... I promise not to do anything that you don't want? okay?... and... you can tell me when you feel uncomfortable with me okay?...".<br />
Lisa: "Okay Izaque, thanks for that... I mean... asking that... It's a promise, right? :3".<br />
Izaque: "Yes, I promise, Lisa :3".<br />
Lisa: "Thanks Izaque ^^".<br />
Izaque: "No problem Lisa ^^".<br />
Then Lisa got up, walked to the front of the Teleporter, opened the door and came inside, she closed the door and selected the Discord ID of Izaque, which was Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX (Censored).<br />
A blue light appeared inside the Teleporter and Lisa disappeared from her spaceship, reappearing on the Teleporter of Izaque.<br />
Izaque looked behind and Lisa was there, she walked outside of the Teleporter and was barefooted with a gray coat, she was so beautiful, the ambient lights of the spaceship shone on her.<br />
He could see her beautiful streams of gray hair, Izaque thought she was amazing and gorgeous, it was incredible to see her in person.<br />
"Hey, Izaque... why are you making that face? It looks like you saw a ghost haha" asks Lisa while laughing a little.<br />
"It's that I... hm... I think you're pretty cute Lisa... and beautiful too... I love you hair... s-sorry to say this..." replied Izaque.<br />
"Hm... no need to apologize... you already said that in Discord... but personally is different... thanks for the compliments Izaque!... I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful... t-thanks..." said Lisa while blushing.<br />
"No problem... hm... I'm a little... shy now... you know," said Izaque.<br />
"Y-Yea... me too... sorry..." replied Lisa.<br />
"No need to say sorry..." said Izaque.<br />
"Can I sit on your bed?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Of course!, feel at home Lisa" replied Izaque.<br />
"Thanks..." said Lisa, who had sat on the bed.<br />
"So... do you want to eat something?... or... watch a movie..." asked Izaque.<br />
"Hm... actually, Izaque... I want you to teach me how to talk with people... come here and sit with me... on the bed..." said Lisa.<br />
Izaque then got up and sat by the side of Lisa, he looked at her beautiful green eyes and she looked at his eyes too.<br />
"So... hm... how do you talk to people?" asked Lisa.<br />
"You simply talk with them, try to talk with some people to get used to it... talk to me, Wendy, Ted, Monika, John, Marina, I'm sure they will be happy to talk with you, you're a pretty cool girl to talk with," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, thanks Izaque, thank you so much, I'll try to talk with them... personally I mean, I'll try to ask them if I can teleport to their spaceships" replied Lisa.<br />
"Okay, try that, I think that will help," said Izaque.<br />
Then Lisa blushed a little and laid on the bed.<br />
"Do you want to eat or watch something?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Maybe... hm... y-yes... I want... hm... hey Izaque..." said Lisa.<br />
"Yes?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I want you to... I mean... do you like me?... as a friend..." asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, I like you as a friend..." replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh... hm... me too, do you like my body?..." said Lisa who was blushing like a tomato.<br />
"Y-Yes... I like your hair, it is cute... your face is beautiful... I like... your legs... hm... sorry..." said Izaque while blushing.<br />
"It's okay... I like your hair too... your lips... your face is pretty cute... I like your hands..." said Lisa as she blushed a little.<br />
"T-Thanks Lisa... hm... I'm really happy that you think that... I'm happy you're here with me... I like your companionship..." said Izaque.<br />
"Thank you Izaque, I'm happy here with you too, and no problem, do you want to do something with me?... I-I mean... not in that way, of course, O////O," asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes... n-not in that way too... I want to watch a movie with you... hm... can I turn on my computer?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Of course, the computer is yours," replied Lisa.<br />
Then Izaque got up and clicked on the blue button on his computer case and the login screen appeared, he typed his password and opened the Netflix app.<br />
He looked to Lisa which was behind him and asked if she wanted to watch Eromanga Sensei.<br />
She replied that it was her favorite anime and she liked to draw just like Sagiri.<br />
Izaque was happy because of that, he opened the anime on Netflix, the first episode, and paused it.<br />
"You would like something to eat?, you can pick up in the fridge there," said Izaque.<br />
"Okay, thanks Izaque," said Lisa.<br />
Then Lisa got up and grabbed a plate with some pieces of chocolate cake and a can of coke, she sat at the right side of the double bed and looked at the computer screen.<br />
Izaque activated the large 50-inch television that emerged from the inside of the wall and opened the fridge to grab a sack of Doritos and two cans of coke.<br />
He grabbed a TV controller and sat on the left side of the bed with his food, he laid his sack of Doritos on the bed and played the first episode.<br />
Izaque opened his first can of coke and drank it a little, Lisa also opened hers and drank it a little, then she started eating some pieces of her chocolate cake.<br />
They both watched the episode, Izaque and Lisa loved that anime, they liked to see Sagiri drawing, her brother as a writer.<br />
Lisa felt that she was like Sagiri, drawing and being alone in her room, listening to music and watching anime.<br />
Izaque felt that he was like Masamune, writing fiction and stories, trying to sell them, but he also felt like he was like Sagiri, liking being alone shut in her room.<br />
"I feel like you're my older brother Izaque... I feel like I'm Sagiri and you're Masamune... hm... is it weird if I feel that way?..." asked Lisa.<br />
"Of course not... it is normal, I feel like that too... I feel like you're my younger sister, like Sagiri, you're as cute as her, and have gray hair too..." said Izaque.<br />
"O-Oh... thanks Izaque... you're cute too... my older brother... h-hey Izaque..." said Lisa.<br />
"Yes?..." said Izaque.<br />
"Do you want to lay on my lap?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes... I-I would like to do that... you will caress me?" asked Izaque while blushing a lot.<br />
"Of course..." said Lisa.<br />
Then Izaque laid his food and cans of coke on the floor and laid his head on the lap of Lisa.<br />
Lisa began to caress the head of Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, Lisa," said Izaque.<br />
"No problem..." said Lisa.<br />
"Hey... Izaque..." said Lisa.<br />
"Yes?," asked Izaque.<br />
"I think I'm comfortable to be with you right now... I mean... being here with you on your spaceship, I feel good, I feel great... and I'm happy here with you... thanks for letting me come here..." said Lisa.<br />
"Oh... I'm happy that you're comfortable here with me Lisa... I'm pretty comfortable here with you too, so... thanks... I feel good, great and happy too, thank you for making me company today," said Izaque.<br />
"No problem my dear..." said Lisa.<br />
"Hehe, my love," said Izaque.<br />
"My dear, my love... hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"C-Can I kiss your cheek?... h-hm... s-s-sowwy Lisa... I t-think what I said was a little weird..." said Izaque while stuttering and trembling a little. <br />
"Y-You can... feel free to kiss my cheek Izaque, don't worry, it wasn't weird to say that, you're a pretty great friend..." said Lisa.<br />
"Okay," said Izaque, then he gave a small and quick kiss on the cheek of Lisa.<br />
She blushed a lot and giggled a little, feeling happy and shy.<br />
"T-Thanks Izaque... I liked the kiss... OwO," said Lisa.<br />
(Author: Aaaaaaaaaaaaa- what am I doing with my character)<br />
"No problem Lisa..." replied Izaque.<br />
Then they were in the half of episode two, Lisa was a little tired and wanted to sleep.<br />
"Hey Izaque, I'm a little tired, sorry," says Lisa while letting out a long yawn.<br />
"It's okay, do you want to go now? I had fun, don't worry, I loved having your company today," says Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I'm happy that you like my presence and enjoys being with me Izaque, thanks, I think I'll go to my spaceship," says Lisa while smiling.<br />
"Okay, I'll pause the anime, do you want to come here again?, to watch something, or play a little, maybe I can activate the double computer module from the SpaceShip," says Izaque while smiling happily.<br />
"Yes, I would like to come here again to spend time with you, I would like to play or watch something again," replies Lisa, smiling while looking at Izaque.<br />
"Okay, then, send me a message on Discord when you want to come here again okay?" asks Izaque, looking at the eyes of Lisa and feeling happy.<br />
"I will, thanks Izaque," says Lisa.<br />
She gets up and throws her can of coke on the trash bin of the TPF Fridge and also the plate where she ate the chocolate cake.<br />
Lisa walks to the Teleporter and looks at Izaque, she is trying to say something but begins to stutter and blush.<br />
Then she builds up courage and says:<br />
"Hey, Izaque... I would like a hug before I go, c-can you please g-give me one?" says Lisa, while trying to look at the eyes of Izaque, her heart beating faster and her becoming shyer and blushing more, she is unsure if that is what she wants, and she gets a little uncomfortable.<br />
Then Izaque says "Yes, of course, I can..." and walks closer to Lisa, she gets more and more embarrassed as he comes closer to her, he hugs her tight and she hugs him back in return, he starts caressing her soft gray hair, Lisa feels happy and fulfilled, feeling the embrace of Izaque and hearing his breath, Lisa is right where she wants to be now, she is now sure that this is what she wanted.<br />
Izaque is happy in that moment, he didn't know he would be able to hug her, his dearest friend, he liked her a lot, and feeling so close to her made him feel secure, joyful and glad, hearing her breath and feeling her embrace, he wanted that moment to last forever, Izaque wished that he could live forever so he could experience a lot more than that.<br />
After hugging for a while, Lisa and Izaque broke from the hug and Lisa smiled, Izaque smiled back.<br />
"Thanks, Izaque, I had fun today..." says Lisa while smiling from ear to ear and looking at Izaque, her eyes shining.<br />
"No problem Lisa, I had fun today too... thanks for spending so much time with me, it felt great, I love you, my friend," replies Izaque, beaming with joy.<br />
"I love you too, my dearest friend," says Lisa while some tears come up in her eyes, then she enters the teleporter and clicks on a button named 'Teleport To My SpaceShip (Lisa)', waving goodbye while smiling at Izaque, and Izaque waving goodbye back, as the light of the Teleporter begins to shine, she disappears, back to her spaceship, Izaque looks at the Teleporter, then to the white floor.<br />
And starts thinking about his day and tries to consolidate everything he lived through the day, he was just having a boring day at his SpaceShip, then Lisa began talking to him, asking him if she could come over to his spaceship.<br />
He was so happy receiving that message, he sats on the bed and thinks about Lisa, smiling from ear to ear without realizing, recalling the feeling of her hug, her embrace, and her voice, the feeling of watching something with her, it was great.<br />
The two cans of coke and the Doritos sack is still there on the floor, he grabs the cans and put them in the trash bin of the TPF Fridge, then does the same to the Doritos sack, the Fridge deletes everything that is inside the trash bin.<br />
Izaque lays on his bed and thinks about Lisa for a while, daydreaming a little.<br />
Then, he stands up and sits on his chair, deactivating the 50-inch screen and closing the Netflix app, he opens up Discord and sends a message to Lisa, who is offline at the time being.<br />
His username on Discord is 'Funkysnipa Cat'.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, thanks for spending time with me, I liked to watch your favorite anime with you, I think I'm really like Masamune xD, thank you for drinking coke with me, and... h-hm... for the other things we did... you know... me laying in your lap...".<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "You caressing my hair... and hugging me... I was really happy... t-to be with you today, thanks, Lisa, I love you so much, my friend <3".<br />
He sent the message, grabbed a bottle of cold water from the Fridge and put a song to play on Foobar2000, his music-player on the computer.<br />
The song he was playing was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4" class="w3-text-white">K/DA - POP/STARS (ft. Madison Beer, (G)I-DLE, Jaira Burns) | Music Video - League of Legends</a>.<br />
He liked that song a lot and was addicted to it, Izaque began drinking some sips of his cold water bottle, feeling refreshed, then he noticed that Lisa was online on Discord, she began typing, replying to him.<br />
After a while, she sent a message, it was:<br />
Lisa: "hey, Izaque, thanks for spending time with me too, I was really happy and glad I could meet you in person, and I was happy to watch Eromanga Sensei, Sagiri is like me xD, the coke was great, and...".<br />
Lisa: "hm... yeah... that part of the visit was great too... your hair was so soft to caress, and your embrace was so good to feel... thanks for hugging me... and saying that I'm beautiful... I'm really happy and thankful for that, Izaque, it made me so happy, thanks for having me, I love you so much, my friend <3 :3".<br />
Then Izaque reads the message while drinking water, smiling happily, after some sips, he leaves the bottle on the table and begins typing, replying to Lisa and thanking her.<br />
Izaque then says goodnight to his friends at Discord and leaves his computer on, with a Custom Status saying: ":spaceliving: Sleeping at the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Zzz...".<br />
He lays in his bed and the SpaceShip lights turn off, leaving only the light of the stars, the moon, sun and Earth to light the spaceship, he covers himself and sleeping, relaxing and having good dreams.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
At Lisa's spaceship...<br />
Lisa is eating some Doritos while listening to a podcast about nutrition, looking at her screen and drinking coke sometimes, she thinks a little about Izaque and her trip to his SpaceShip, she had fun there and was happy, Lisa wants to go there again.<br />
After a while, she finishes emptying the sack of Doritos and the can of coke.<br />
She places the sack and can on the trash bin of the Fridge and it deletes both of them.<br />
Then Lisa pauses the podcast, saves the part where she stopped and closes the podcast app.<br />
The gray-haired girl says goodnight to her friends on Discord, and also to Wendy and John.<br />
She wonders if Ted and Monika are having fun there, Lisa only saw them on the SpaceLiving2YearAnniversaryMeeting™ but never talked to them.<br />
Lisa decides that she will talk to them tomorrow on Discord, she leaves her computer on and adds a Custom Status to Discord saying: ":spaceliving: Sleeping at the SpaceLiving Ship :3".<br />
She lays in her bed and the lights of the SpaceShip turn off, Lisa is having a good dream.<br />
