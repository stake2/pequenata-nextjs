There was a boy that lived in a LonelyShip too, his name was "Ted".<br />
But his spaceship was different, it had a teletransporter.<br />
He could go back to Earth when he wanted to.<br />
To see his family, and to know about the news of the Earth.<br />
He was a little famous in his city, being one of the only people who could leave their LonelyShips.<br />
He liked his life, he was still a civilian on Earth, but he liked to live in his LonelyShip.<br />
One day he was sat in his computer, eating some lasagna with coca-cola while watching a livestream of the Youtuber Cellbit.<br />
Then after eating he got up and picked up a bottle of water, he placed the bottle on the table.<br />
Ted then dragged the livestream window to his second screen, and opened Netflix on the Mozilla Firefox browser.<br />
He took a look at the catalog, he didn't found anything that he was interested to watch.<br />
Then he closed the browser and the livestream, and opened Steam to play some games, he started playing Terraria.<br />
He played on a multi-player server, he played for a little and then closed the game.<br />
Ted missed his family and the life in Earth, he turned off his computer and activated the teletransporter.<br />
After waiting some time, the teletransporter was ready, he entered it and typed the id of Planet Earth.<br />
He has been teleported to Earth, and appeared on the house of his parents.<br />
His parents were eating, they noticed that Ted was there, they got up to hug Ted.<br />
The parents of Ted said they missed him, and they cried a little together.<br />
Then his parents said they were gonna go to the market.<br />
The parents of Ted left the house and Ted said he was going to downtown.<br />
Ted locked the house and got a backpack with somethings.<br />
After walking a little Ted arrived at downtown, he wanted to see a friend of him.<br />
That he talked with on the internet, he also had a smartphone on his LonelyShip.<br />
His dad was called Pedro, his mom was called Jana.<br />
Ted meet his friend 2 years ago.<br />
His friend was a girl called Monika, he knew where she lived.<br />
Ted sent a message to Monika through his smartphone saying that he was coming to her house.<br />
Monika said she was happy about that, and that she was excited to see him again.<br />
Then Ted started walking to her house, he arrived and knocked on the door.<br />
Monika then opened the door and let Ted in.<br />
Then Monika told Ted to feel at home.<br />
Ted entered the house and sat on the couch.<br />
Monika asked if he wanted some water, Ted replied positively.<br />
Then Monika brought a glass of water.<br />
Ted drank it and gave it back to Monika.<br />
Monika then came back to the kitchen and placed the cup on the sink.<br />
Monika came back to the living room and sat at the couch.<br />
Ted was a little uncomfortable because of that.<br />
He wasn't used to being so close to a person like that.<br />
Then Monika asked how he was doing, Ted said he was doing great.<br />
Monika said that she liked him, they both looked in the eyes of each other.<br />
Ted was blushing a little and said that he liked Monika too.<br />
Then Ted asked if Monika liked to live that way, in Earth.<br />
Monika was a little uncomfortable about that question.<br />
She took a while to reply.<br />
Then Monika said she liked that, but she would like to live as a LonelyShipper.<br />
Ted asked if she wanted to spend some time there.<br />
Monika said she wanted, but she was afraid of letting her house alone.<br />
Then Ted said that she could call someone trustworthy to take care of the house.<br />
Monika said that that was a good idea, then she said that she was going to think about that for a while.<br />
Ted said that was good to see her again, and that she was still beautiful.<br />
Monika blushed a little and said "Thank you!".<br />
Then Monika said that he was beautiful too.<br />
Ted said "Thank you...".<br />
Monika said: "Don't you want to stay for a coffee?".<br />
Ted replied: "Oh, okay".<br />
Then Monika got up and walked towards the kitchen, she started making coffee.<br />
Ted sat at the chair and waited for Monika to prepare the coffee.<br />
They talked a little and then the coffee was ready.<br />
Monika and Ted sat at the table and Monika poured some coffee and milk for Ted.<br />
Ted said: "Hmm... I wanna ask you something...".<br />
Then Monika said: "What?".<br />
Ted said: "A pretty girl like you must have a boyfriend right?".<br />
Then Monika replied blushed and shy: "Oh... haha, thank you Ted but I don't have a boyfriend".<br />
Ted said: "Oh... so... we already know each other a lot right?".<br />
Monika said: "Y-yes... and I really like you...".<br />
Ted said: "Me too...".<br />
Monika got closer to Ted and said: "So... do you like me more than a friend?...".<br />
Ted said: "What do you mean?...".<br />
Monika said: "That... like... as a girlfriend?".<br />
Ted was a little shy and said: "Uhh... maybe... like... do you want to be my girlfriend?".<br />
Monika blushed and said: "Y-yes...".<br />
Then Ted hugged Monika, Monika kissed Ted.<br />
Monika said: "I want to go with you to your LonelyShip...".<br />
Ted said: "You're sure about that?".<br />
Monika said: "Yes!, I love you!".<br />
Ted said: "I love you too honey, I'm happy that you want to live with me".<br />
Monika said: "I'm happy too...".<br />
Then Monika started packing up her things.<br />
Monika gave her house to a relative and picked up the $30.000 dollars she had in a bank account.<br />
Then Monika came to the house of Ted and they were prepared to teleport to the LonelyShip.<br />
They teleported and got off the teletransporter. <br />
When Monika got off the teletransporter the spaceship began to shake a little and the tables and walls were moving and changing.<br />
After sometime a new computer, PS4, bed, bathroom and fridge was there.<br />
Monika placed her stuff on the floor and got closer to the bed, on the wall of the bed was some buttons.<br />
She pushed a pink button and the bed, fridge, table and walls got painted pink.<br />
Monika said: "This is awesome!", and hugged Ted.<br />
Ted said: "Yes, it is!".<br />
There was also a wardrobe there, Monika stored her things there.<br />
She laid on her bed and said: "This spaceship is really cool".<br />
Ted said: "Yea".<br />
Monika was prepared to start a new life in that spaceship, doing a lot of things and being with her love.<br />
Ted said: "This isn't a LonelyShip anymore, its a LovelyShip, haha".<br />
Monika said: "Yea, lol".<br />
