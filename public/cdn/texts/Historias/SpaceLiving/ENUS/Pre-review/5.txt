*The message disappears...*</i><br />
A LonelyShipper was seeing this message, she was in her LonelyShip, the walls of the spaceship had the Navy Blue color,<br />
She had a Bed, ThoughtPoweredFridge, Bathroom, a Computer, Smartphone and PS4, she also had a Musical Keyboard,<br />
She loved to learn and train with the keyboard, she was very good at it, some time she sent a cover of the song "Faded" to a friend,<br />
That friend was called Izaque, Izaque liked the music cover, and said that Wendy had talent,<br />
Wendy was very happy reading that, Wendy also liked to play some games on her computer,<br />
She loved to eat too, because it was easy to eat on a LonelyShip, you just think about the food, open the Fridge and the food will be there,<br />
Izaque liked to write some stories, he would sent the link of a new chapter to Wendy every time he made one,<br />
Wendy liked to read the stories of Izaque, Izaque thought that Wendy was a really good friend, and he liked to talk to her,<br />
They talked using Discord, when Izaque learned that Wendy was a LonelyShipper too, he became happier than before,<br />
Izaque loved his LonelyShip, Wendy too, Izaque loved to listen to some Dubstep in his Ship, blasting it on the speakers,<br />
Izaque also made livestreams on Twitch, showing what he was doing, to his subscribers,<br />
He liked to download songs from SoundCloud, to play games on Steam, to write stories and post on Wattpad, Fanfiction and in the sites that he made by himself,<br />
Wendy liked to listen to some chill music, and to watch videos on Youtube, <br />
One day Izaque was reading a really good and atmospheric story on the Fimfiction website,<br />
It was about the My Little Pony cartoon and the Don't Starve game together, he recommended the story to Wendy,<br />
He liked so much those two things, and those things together were better than anything,<br />
There was one day where Izaque didn't made a livestream, he watched a movie called The Avengers: Infinite War,<br />
He ate pizzas, hamburgers and lots of coca-cola while watching the two hour movie,<br />
He loved to do that, watch that awesome movie, Izaque added the movie to his watched list on his website called Watch History,<br />
Izaque also used a software on his computer called Foobar2000, which was a Music Player, Izaque had 25Gigabytes of music on his hard drive,<br />
He liked to have a lot of music, and he called himself a Music Hoarder,<br />
Izaque was also a friend of one of the founders of ThinkOutsideTheBox, he liked the new Update they made to the LonelyShips,<br />
The Double-Ship, WallColorChange, ShipInvite, EquipmentChange, he liked all the new changes and new features,<br />
Izaque sure loved to be a LonelyShipper and to live in a LonelyShip,<br />
He even created a Discord Server about it, and talked to a lot of friends on Discord about how to become a LonelyShipper,<br />
Wendy also liked to sleep, and to play some keyboard on her spaceship, she loved to be a LonelyShipper,<br />
Back when she was still in earth, she wanted to live alone, she liked to use the computer and smartphone,<br />
She liked to see the stars, the planets and the earth from her window,<br />
Wendy had some luck too, because no asteroids crossed the way of her spaceship,<br />
Izaque had an asteroid coming in the direction of his spaceship, then the security system activated and a big laser turret appeared in the top of the spaceship,<br />
Destroying the asteroid completely, Izaque wasn't scared by the asteroid, because he knew how the spaceship worked, and knewthat it would protect him,<br />
He loved to study and to learn about the LonelyShips, SpaceLiving and the ThinkOutsideTheBox company,<br />
With the new update 1.3.709, Izaque and Wendy could visit their families, they liked that, to see them again,<br />
Izaque missed his family, he hugged all of them, his sisters, his brother, his father and mother,<br />
He was used to being in earth and to talk to humans, even if he had spent a lot of time inside the LonelyShip,<br />
Izaque asked if someone wanted to live there with him, but no one wanted,<br />
Then he said "See you later" to all of them, he came inside the Teleporter that was in the house of his parents,<br />
And came back to the LonelyShip, a robot female voice greeted him, saying: "Welcome back, Izaque",<br />
Izaque installed that voice using the Desktop App "SpaceLiving ThinkOutsideTheBox",<br />
The spaceship of Izaque already had a lot of good things and good equipment, a good screen, PS4,<br />
Good computer, good internet, he was happy with what he had,<br />
He wanted to talk more with Lisa, Wendy, Igor and other friends he had on Discord,<br />
He wanted to talk more in the "Discord do Cellbit" server,<br />
Izaque was tired, he listened to some Dubstep music on his computer, then watched a small episode of the anime Eromanga Sensei while eating chocolate cookies,<br />
He added the episode to his Watched List and turned off the computer, he laid in his bed and slept.<br />
