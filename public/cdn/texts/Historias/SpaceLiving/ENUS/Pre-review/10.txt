<b>Title: The Visit of Lisa</b><br /><br />
Wendy was playing some keyboard on her spaceship, it was the theme song of the Titanic movie, she liked to practice keyboard.<br />
Izaque was thinking about his days at school, he had a lot of friends there and liked talking to them every day, the food was not very good but he liked.<br />
Monika was talking to some of her friends on Discord, one friend of hers was called Sayori.<br />
Monika said: "hey Sayori, how are you?..."<br />
Sayori: "hey Monika, I'm fine, how about you?"<br />
Monika: "I'm good too, just living here in the spaceship with my boyfriend Ted"<br />
Sayori: "Oh, I got a part-time job with Yuri, it is on a library"<br />
Monika: "That sounds very sweet Sayori, good luck on your job! What about Yuri?"<br />
Sayori: "Well... she liked the job because she loves books, so I guess its a really good job for her"<br />
Ted was playing some Titanfall 2 with his friends, after that he changed to Terraria.<br />
Izaque got a notification on the Discord server of SpaceLiving saying that a new SpaceLiver has arrived.<br />
The message says: "@Funkysnipa Cat#1778 Hello, a new SpaceLiver has arrived!, it would be good if you could greet them and explain to them about the SpaceLiving Network, thanks for your help! :)"<br />
Izaque then added the new SpaceLiver on Discord, she was called Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hello, I'm an admin at the SpaceLiving Discord server, they told me that you're new here, so... need help with anything? :)"<br />
Her user-name was Peach_Army, she said: "I wanted to know where I am, where all of this came from and who's the owner of this rabbit?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said: "Well... this spaceship is called "LonelyShip", she is hovering some kilometers away from earth, if you look through the window you will see the earth."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "This bunny was given to you because you had thought before coming here about having a bunny, and then the spaceship gave it to you."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Don't worry, if you want to go back home you can click on the icon on your computer and click on "Teleport back to earth..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "The spaceship teleported you because it felt your desire, about living alone, only with a computer, food, a bathroom, this happened with me too, and with everyone at the server."<br />
Marina looked at the window and thought about the earth for a little, about everything she went through there, then she decides something and walks to the computer and types on the shiny keys.<br />
Peach_Army: "I want to stay."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm, I'm happy for you, I can assure you will be so much happy here, I hope I have helped you, we can be friends?... my name is Izaque."<br />
Peach_Army: "Well, if I'm gonna stay alone here with... the bunny, then yes, we can be friends."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh that's good, I'm glad, what's your name?"<br />
Peach_Army: "My name is Marina, nice to meet you."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Nice to meet you too Marina."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "So... what do you like to do on the computer? :D"<br />
Marina: "I try to compose songs, play some games of strategy and talk a little"<br />
Marina: "I also see doramas"<br />
Marina: "and study"<br />
Marina: "How about you?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Well, I watch anime, write some stories, talk with some friends here on Discord, help the new people who arrive, I love to play too, on Xbox One, PS4"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "And studying was one of the boring things that I did in my life on earth xD, why do you study? or what you study?"<br />
Marina: "Actually, studying was one of the things I loved the most on Earth"<br />
Marina: "I like to know that what I learn will always innovate"<br />
Marina: "I must have been one of the only people who like math"<br />
Marina: "xD"<br />
Marina: "And I study Asian culture"<br />
Marina: "Mostly the Korean"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "lol, I think I can drop the "first capital letter" and use period, they say I can't be friends with the people I help get to SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think I didn't like to learn what I wouldn't use like history, Brazilian Portuguese, or the things of the school, but I love to learn about technology"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I love Japanese culture"<br />
Marina: "One of my favorites too lol"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "hahaha"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I love to show this New World to people, because I love to live in it, the SpaceLiving, but I don't like the rules, like the one I told you about"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "do you know the name of the company that created the SpaceLiving Network?"<br />
Marina: "no.."<br />
Marina: "Which one?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Its ThinkOutsideTheBox or TOTB"<br />
Marina: "How the families of the people of SpaceLiving feel like?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think they get sad, but some don't care, because they don't care about the relative, they receive a message like a hologram, telling that their relative of them is on a SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "you can eat what you want on the fridge, but your relatives can send special food for you if they want, just let them know"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "like food from your grandma or mom that you love"<br />
Marina: "I see..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "there's also a teleporter on the spaceship that can teleport you to a house that you consider trustworthy like your parents' house to visit if you miss them"<br />
Marina: "I was going to ask that now xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "just go there and think "my dad's house" "my mom's house" or something, and click a button called "Submit" "<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "the person who lives in the house of your choice will receive the notification and will choose to accept or not, then a teleporter will be created in the chosen house"<br />
Marina: "Got it..."<br />
Marina: "I think I'll like it here"<br />
Marina: "It seems my dream has finally come true, without the problems of others surrounding me"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "That's very good Marina, this was my dream too, and living alone too, I love computers"<br />
Marina: "My computer gave life to me xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think there's a boy who writes stories about this spaceship"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Or his spaceship in this case, maybe this boy is me xD, just maybe..."<br />
Marina: "Really?!"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "yes Hahaha xD"<br />
Marina: "I'd love to read your story someday"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I'd love to send it to you"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "there are already some chapters published"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "want the link?"<br />
Marina: "Yes, Please"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/" class="w3-text-white">https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/</a>"<br />
Marina: "Thank you"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "you're welcome, thanks for reading"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think in chapter 5 there's an invite to the SpaceLiving server, but that's kind of useless since you're already on it"<br />
Marina: "So, who reads till Chapter 5, and is on Earth, can go to SpaceLiving?!"<br />
Marina: "If I had known I would have read your story before xDDD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xDD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Well... no, I just send this story to someone that is already on a ship"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "But I think there are some internet tutorials on how to be "invited" to live on a SpaceLiving"<br />
Marina: "I've never seen anything about it"<br />
Marina: "I would have liked it a lot"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Me too"<br />
Marina: "I'll talk to you later, I'm gonna watch an anime here, see ya later :3"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "See you later Marina :3"<br />
Then Marina walked close to her TPF(Thought-Powered-Fridge) and thought about a coca-cola and a slice of pizza.<br />
She sat at her chair and laid the cup and plate on the top of the table, then downloaded an episode of the anime called Eromanga Sensei to watch.<br />
Marina ate the food and drank the soda while watching, she loved to watch anime while eating.<br />
After that, she was feeling a little tired, she said goodnight to Izaque and laid on her bed, then slept.<br />
