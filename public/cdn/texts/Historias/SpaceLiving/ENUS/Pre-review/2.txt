Still, in the year 2019, there was this tale, of a super innovative spaceship.<br />
The company that made those spaceships were called by the name ThinkOutsiteTheBox.<br />
The spaceships were called "LonelyShips" because you were lonely there.<br />
There were a lot of people that lived in the LonelyShips, they created a community.<br />
And a lot of Discord servers to communicate and talk about being a LonelyShipper.<br />
It was like a movement, a social movement, just like the bronies, furries and 4channers were some years ago.<br />
These three specific movements are still active, but they aren't as famous as before.<br />
They liked to be in that movement, Lisa didn't participate in that.<br />
She was just her, spending her own time at the computer, without a movement or stereotype.<br />
There was also a boy named John, he had 17 years old, he liked to play games.<br />
A lot of games, he was very competitive at them and didn't like to lose.<br />
He was at his LonelyShip, he didn't know what time was on earth.<br />
He only wanted to play games, he was thinking about some things while being laid at his bed.<br />
He thought: "Why I am at this bed?, I was really alone, and I wanted to stay away from the others,<br />
Because they enraged me, I was suffering because of them, and I was being annoyed by them too,<br />
Also, I feel that I was someone in another place or alternate universe,<br />
Like I was some kind of hero or teacher of martial arts like I was teaching some friends,<br />
And was teaching two persons, Juju and Sizaque I think,<br />
I should stop thinking about that, maybe I'm too tired or something, I should get back to the computer".<br />
Then John got off his bed and turned the computer on, he opened Steam to play some games.<br />
John also had a friend called Mark, John felt that they were friends on an alternate universe.<br />
John opened Apex Legends to play, it was a new game that EA launched, he wanted to test it.<br />
He played for a few minutes and liked it, he was very good at the game.<br />
Then he closed the game and called his friend Mark to play some Overwatch on Discord.<br />
They played a little while talking by voice-call, Mark also lived in a LonelyShip.<br />
After some time playing John won some rounds and wanted to exit, he said "See you later" to Mark.<br />
Mark said the same, John liked to read some stories on the internet, he wanted to write too.<br />
But he wasn't very good at it, he liked to read the stories of a girl named Lisa, that was a LonelyShipper too.<br />
Lisa has published a lot of stories, she loved to write those ones.<br />
John was studying writing and stories to learn a little, he has made some drafts on his computer.<br />
He wanted to talk to Lisa, to ask her for help on writing, he noticed that she puts her Discord name and id in all of her stories.<br />
The text said: "If you want help in writing or like my stories and want to talk about them just add me on Discord: Lisa#1321".<br />
Then John added her on Discord, John already liked and commented on the chapters of some stories of Lisa.<br />
But he wanted to talk to her and to ask questions to her, about writing and how to write better.<br />
--(Author: And what I'm doing right now? writing, inception.)<br />
John sent a message to her, he said: "Hi, how are you?, I'm John from Wattpad, I love your stories".<br />
"You wrote your Discord on your stories, right? you said people could ask for help in writing or talk about your stories".<br />
"Sorry for asking so many questions, It's that I started just some months ago, and was trying to get better at writing".<br />
After some time John noticed that she was online, he got excited to receive a reply.<br />
Lisa replied: "Hey, John, I know you from Wattpad :), your comment and give me a lot of likes, thanks for loving my stories,<br />
And thanks for commenting and liking them, yes, I did that, you can ask for help or talk with me about my stories :3,<br />
It's ok asking questions, I started some months ago too, can I see a piece of your work? like, the story you're most proud of".<br />
Them John replied: "Yes, I will send a text file, ok?".<br />
"Ok then", said Lisa.<br />
Then John sent Lisa a file named "The Return of the Beast.txt" of 4KB.<br />
After some time reading Lisa started writing a message to John, she said:<br />
"That was cool to read, the story was interesting, but the way you executed it, that was a little..."<br />
John: "Bad?".<br />
Lisa: "Not bad, but, was not... the way you express yourself, or the way you write, like, try to read more".<br />
Lisa: "Try to read more and to learn more about how to use words, and how to form phrases, I guess that's my Monika Tip-".<br />
Lisa: "I mean, I guess that's my tip for you, try that".<br />
John: "Ok, I will try that, thanks for helping me, like, I was scared and excited to talk to you".<br />
Lisa: "Why?".<br />
John: "Cause I loved your work, and thought you were an inaccessible person".<br />
Lisa: "If I were inaccessible why I would put my discord tag in my stories?, also I live in a LonelyShip, so I'm very accessible".<br />
John: "Oh, that's cool, I live in one too, what is your age?".<br />
Lisa: "16, and you? my name is Lisa btw".<br />
John: "17, my name is John".<br />
Lisa: "Ok John, I liked to talk to you, but I'm gonna write some "The Odds of Nature" right now, ok?".<br />
John: "Ok, sorry to bother you".<br />
Lisa: "You didn't bother me, also I want to read your stories when you get better :)".<br />
John: "It would be an honor to send you some of them :D".<br />
Lisa: "Ok, see you later John :3".<br />
John: "See you later Lisa :)".<br />
After that John minimized his Discord and started searching how to write better and how to use words better.<br />
He wanted to get better at writing to show Lisa his stories, he was super excited to do that.<br />
He learned a lot and was trying to make some drafts.<br />
After some time writing he wrote something that he liked, he was tired, he yawned and relaxed back in the chair.<br />
He turned off his computer and laid in bed to sleep, he wanted to talk to Lisa again.<br />
He slept.<br />
