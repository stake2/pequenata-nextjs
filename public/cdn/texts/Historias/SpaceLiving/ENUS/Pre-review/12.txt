<b>Title: Teleportation attempt, The dream</b><br /><br />
Izaque was on his spaceship, he was on his computer, listening to a song called The Brig - Mind Changer.<br />
He was thinking about Marina, her friend that also lives in a spaceship, he wanted to see her again, even though they had seen each other last night.<br />
Izaque was thinking of calling Lisa to visit his spaceship for a few hours, he opened Discord and talk to her.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, do you know about the new system of teleport between the SpaceShips?..."<br />
Lisa: "Yes, what's up?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think you already know that I visited the spaceship of Marina, right?"<br />
Lisa: "Yea, I know about that, what you're trying to say?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I want to say is that I want you to visit my spaceship or me to visit yours..."<br />
Lisa: "Oh..."<br />
Lisa: "Well... I think so... I want to visit you..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh... it'll be great... I think..."<br />
Lisa: "Yes... well, Izaque, I'm afraid of something..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "What?..."<br />
Lisa: "Marina already visited your spaceship, and... I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want... did you do something... naughty with her?..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Of course not... I only watched a movie with her and we ate some things, then she came back to her spaceship, I wouldn't do anything like that with you if you didn't want..."<br />
Lisa: "Hm... ok... can you call me now?... like... do the thing that teleports me there?..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm... I'm sorry in advance, but I'm kinda busy now, can it be later?..."<br />
Izaque then looks at the clock of his computer, it says "00:20".<br />
Lisa: "Ah, that's okay, I'm kinda busy here too"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Okay, see you later my bb, love you &lt;3"<br />
Lisa: "Love you Izaque &lt;3, see ya later"<br />
Then Izaque continues using his computer, he watches an episode of Dr. Stone, he loves that anime.<br />
Izaque feels tired, he wants to sleep, Izaque watches an episode of My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic while eating a chocolate cake and drinking a coca-cola.<br />
Then he lies in his bed and closes his eyes, he sleeps, thinking about Marina and Lisa.<br />
Izaque dreams about being a human in Equestria, he is Izaque, a human that has golden wings made of lava fluid, a hand-grappling hook also made of lava fluid.<br />
He is also a half-human half-dragon, he breathes fire and haves lava instead of the normal human gastric acid.<br />
Izaque opens a purple portal and appears inside the Crystal Castle of Twilight Sparkle, she sees him and he sees her, Izaque talks with her:<br />
"Hey Twilight Sparkle!, how are you?" he asks.<br />
"I'm good, and you Izaque?" she replies.<br />
"Me too, long time no see right?" he says.<br />
<br />
Then Twilight replies: "Yea, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".<br />
<br />
Then Izaque told Twilight that he was talking with a friend of him, a friend from a distant place,<br />
Izaque was sat in the blue and comfy carpet that Twilight had, she stopped reading her book to listen to him.<br />
<br />
"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, you know... I wrote this story in 2016, it was called Littletato too,<br />
it was so awesome and is still so awesome to write that, I felt incredible and happy" explains Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Oh... that is very great to hear Izaque!, I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it,<br />
2016 was a long time on Earth right? like... 365 days, you're inspiring me to write a story Izaque!, that makes me soooo happy" replies Twilight.<br />
<br />
Then Izaque says: "Yea, a very long time, well... today right now in Earth is the year of 2019,<br />
I'm glad you're inspired by me Twilight, that makes me so much happy!, I would love to teach you how to write something!" says him.<br />
<br />
"I would love that!, please teach me, Izaque-sensei(teacher)" replies Twilight.<br />
<br />
Then Twilight asks: "Soo... how do you spoke with her? was it good?".<br />
<br />
"Yes, it was pretty good, well, I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and asked for my Discord id, I gave it to her then she added me,<br />
thanked me for everything that I did, even if what I did was just create a story, I'm thankful for meeting her, my creation, haha, that was weird", explains Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that is a pretty good way of meeting someone, even though I don't know what Discord is, is it a network work that Discord created or something?<br />
how can you two connect that way?, sometimes I can't understand Discord, ugh..." says Twilight.<br />
<br />
"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of this land, you know, Discord is only the name for a social network that exists on Earth,<br />
a technology network where people can talk with each other, I also can't understand him, never..." replies Izaque.<br />
<br />
Izaque says: "I also love Sword Art Online a lot, it was a anime on Earth that was launched in 2013, it is an anime, and it was my first anime".<br />
Twilight Sparkle replies: "Wow!, I would love to watch it with you, I bet it is really good, I also have things like that, that reminds me of my childhood, oh, the wonderful books that I've read when I was younger",<br />
"It makes me happy just to think, Izaque... never forget the things that make you feel happy... I love you Izaque".<br />
Twilight hugs Izaque, he says:<br />
"I love you too Twilight...".<br />
After some time hugging Izaque says:<br />
"Hey Twilight, I gotta go home, I will visit you again okay?, I love you" after saying that, Izaque kisses the cheek of the purple pony princess.<br />
"I love you too Izaque, see you" after saying that, Twilight kisses the cheek of the winged human-dragon hybrid back.<br />
Izaque creates another purple portal and goes back to Earth, he closes the portal and turns his computer on.<br />
He opens Wattpad and starts writing Littletato, a story that he loves to write a lot, then he thinks about writing SpaceLiving, another good story that he loves.<br />
Izaque thinks about Duda, Marina, Igor, Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, Wendy, MelodyStar, all of his friends, he loves them a lot.<br />
Then he finishes writing the chapter, he names it 28 - The beautiful Life of Littletato &lt;3, he is so proud of writing that chapter because it makes him so happy.<br />
He thinks about his other story, SpaceLiving, he created it with a friend of him, Julia, it now haves 12 chapters, he loves writing it.<br />
The Izaque from the SpaceLiving universe which is the Izaque that is having this dream right now is feeling all of these things.<br />
He is feeling the emotions of the Earth-MLP Izaque, the New World Izaque, the Nazzevo Izaque, the Old World Earth Izaque.<br />
The SpaceLiving Izaque thinks all of that is weird, that dream.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque feels and sees how it is to be in the skin of Earth Izaque, Earth Izaque is eating a pizza right now, while watching The Walking Dead.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque wakes up and sits in his bed.<br />
He thinks and associates all of that information, he wonders who is the Earth Izaque, who is the New World Izaque, who is Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, MelodyStar.<br />
Izaque turns on his computer and opens Paint, the program that he uses to make pixel art and drawings even if he doesn't draw very often.<br />
He draws a pixel art of his SpaceShip, after some time he says and finishes it:<br />
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileHide" width="66%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a>
<div class="mobileHide"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileShow" width="100%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a>
Izaque becomes very proud of that drawing, he even shares it with some friends of him on Discord, Marina likes it a lot, Lisa too.<br />
Izaque thinks about that story that he dreamed of, Littletato, he knows that he never wrote it, he only wrote Kezzakam and SpaceLiving, also SpaceLivingXGDS.<br />
He searches for it in Wattpad, he finds out that a user, stake2, wrote Littletato, and Izaque uses that name(stake2) through the entire internet, he thinks that is weird.<br />
Izaque wants to sleep again, he is hungry too, he eats a slice of pizza and drinks coke, he turns off his computer and lies in bed again, trying to rest.<br />
He wants to dream more too, to know about things of other universes, the universe of Earth Izaque, of New World Izaque, of Old World Izaque.<br />
Izaque thinks that the fact that a lot of other Izaques exist is weird.<br />
A visual list with texts appears in his mind, he thinks it is a dream, the list says:<br />
"Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, Old World Izaque, SpaceLiving Izaque, Dreamworld Izaque, Nazzevo Izaque, Kingdom of Arstotzka Izaque, 'A Perfect World' Izaque,<br />
Omnipotent Izaque, Nothingness Izaque, Clone Network Izaque, Ilha Deserta Izaque, Relaxing Sunny Days Izaque, Ascencion To Equestria Izaque".<br />
A weird list with a lot of Izaques, a lot of versions of him, a lot of universes, multi-verse.<br />
Izaque(SL) thought that all of that information was a lot to digest, his head hurts, he thinks he haves to be an omnipotent being to understand that.<br />
He is still dreaming, a good and calm dream appears and he can have a good rest now.<br />
An audio message starts playing on the spaceship of Marina, saying: "Marina, come to me... I've sent this message to you by the universe feature that is called...<br />
"'Personal-brain spaceship connector' I guess, well... my name is Jay, I'm a Raptier, I live inside a planet called 'Osiris' in the same galaxy that you're on right now,<br />
The Milky Way, come with me, my id is Jay#3394, I've left a device in your spaceship for you to travel to my planet, there's a lot of nature here, I think it will be good for you,<br />
You can just visit and can go back to your spaceship whenever you want, don't worry, you won't be in any danger, we're a tribe that searches for humans to know us, <br />
Because we're so mistreated and discriminated by humans, we need to be equal with humans, we don't wanna fight, please, visit us, thank you, Jay."<br />
Marina reads all of that, then lies on her bed, she sees the hand teleporter in the floor and thinks about going there at Osiris.<br />
She wonders if it will be good for her.<br />
Or if she will be in danger, she sleeps.<br />
