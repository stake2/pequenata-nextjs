Lisa was sitting in her chair while looking at the computer screen, a notification got her attention.
Someone asked to add her as a friend in Discord, it was someone called Littletato, she looked cute in the picture, Lisa accepted her friend request.
They began to chat:
Lisa: "Hello... do you added me from the SpaceLiving server right?".
Littletato: "Yea... I've met some cool people there, and I thought you looked cool and gentle xD, I'm annoying you in some way?".
Lisa: "Of course not!, I love to talk to new people ^^, you're a SpaceLiver right?, or a LonelyShipper".
Littletato: "Yes, I guess I could be called that way xD, I was just scrolling Facebook at my computer and began floating and a light blue light surrounded my body, I didn't know what was happening, I was very scared...".
Lisa: "Oh... that is one of the rumors that I been hearing, I think it was called Random-Teleport, it isn't the standard procedure for teleporting someone to a SpaceShip, I feel sorry for you...".
Littletato: "Hm, thanks for explaining that to me, I already ate a slice of pizza an watched an anime called Eromanga Sensei, that is enough to be considered a SpaceLiver? xD".
Lisa: "Maybe xD, actually, to be considered a SpaceLiver you have to be teleported to a SpaceLiving ship, there are a lot of cool things to do".
Lisa: "Also... Eromanga Sensei?, I love that anime!, in fact, I look a little like the main character, Sagiri, here... I'll send a pic of me...".

Littletato: "Oh... you're cute xD, and you look like her! :3, I'll send a photo of me... don't look too much, I'm shy... :3".
(Narrator-Izaque: Julia will get mad Littletato... don't send pics to her xD)

Lisa: "Y-You're cute too! :3, hehe, I like your hair, I wanted to have that color, also... it is raining where your SpaceShip is located?, I've never seen a cloud near my spaceship before, this is weird...".
Littletato: "Really? there are no clouds in here, how clouds can exist here if we are living in space xD".
Lisa: "I don't know xD, hey, do you wanna meet some of my friends?".
Littletato: "Um... sure, if they're as cool as you xD".
Lisa: "Well, here's the discord tag of my friend Izaque, he is very cool, also, do you wanna read my stories?, Izaque writes too xD".
Littletato: "I'm gonna add him, send me the link or file you would like me to read, I would love to read something made by you".
Then Littletato asked for the friend request of Izaque and opened the story page of "The Odds of Nature", the story that Lisa had sent to her.
Littletato began chatting with Izaque:
Littletato: "Hello Izaque... Lisa sent me your discord tag so I added you on here, thanks for accepting the friend request, so... do you write stories? UwU".
Izaque: "Well, I'm writing you right now... I-I mean, I'm writing something right now, but you can talk with me :3, I think Lisa didn't tell me that you were going to add me".
Littletato: "Maybe you gotta talk with her about that, also, what you're writing?, I was watching Eromanga Sensei, I told that to Lisa and she told me that she looks like the main character, Sagiri".
Littletato: "She sent me a pic of her... she's very cute, but you already know that right? you guys look to be very close friends...".
Izaque: "Yea, well, actually, she never sent me a pic of her '-'... I'm gonna ask for her to send me a pic xD".
Littletato: "That is weird xD... but probably she would send one to you, I-I...".
Izaque: "What?, I'm not gonna judge you... don't need to worry".
Littletato: "It's not that... I mean, I was teleported here by mistake, I was just minding my own business at my computer and I began floating and a light blue light surrounded me, then I was taken to this spaceship".
Izaque: "So the rumors were true... the Random-Teleport, well, they said that you can go back, right? at least that's what the rumor says...".
Littletato: "Yea, they said that I could right-click the tray icon and select [Teleport back to Earth], maybe it's a glitch or something, and the system called the wrong person?".
Izaque: "Yea, I guess it's that, have you tried clicking that button? probably they will ask for a confirmation, don't worry".
After that, Littletato right-clicked the tray icon and selected [Teleport back to Earth], a message prompted her confirmation saying "Do you really want to teleport back to Earth?".
Littletato came back to the Discord window and sent a message to Izaque saying:
"Yea... you're right, looks like it works, and it asked me for a confirmation...".
Izaque: "Oh, that's cool, I hope you can get back on earth if you really want to, can I send you one of my stories?".
Littletato: "Yes!, I would love to read something made by you ❤️...".
Izaque: "Okay, I'll send it, I'll also add you to the Readers list :3".
Then Izaque sent Littletato a link to his story, Clone Network.
Littletato: "I'm so happy to be on that list! :3".
Izaque: "Thanks for the love and support Littletato, I'm really happy I met you :3 ❤️".
Littletato: "I think I'm gonna finish reading one chapter of The Odds Of Nature and Clone Network, thanks for sending me the link".
Izaque: "Oh, the story of Lisa xD, she has a lot of talent for writing".
Littletato: "I agree with you, makes me feel inside the story".
Izaque: "I feel the same way xD, I think I'm gonna watch something from my To Watch list, Littletato, can I ask you something?".
Littletato: "Yes?...".
Izaque: "C-Can you send me a picture of you?...".
Izaque: "Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that...".
Littletato: "Okay, here it is, it's the same I sent to Lisa".
<a href="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/human pequenata.jpg"><img src="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/human pequenata.jpg" width="20%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Izaque: "Really?... you're really cute! :3... hehe, you have beautiful eyes...".
Littletato: "Thanks Izaque! :3 ^w^, can you send me one of you too?, I am shy and embarrassed now...".
Izaque: "Oh, sorry, I forgot!".
(Well, guess I can't put that pic here xD, reader, I'm shy, sorry, please ask for my discord tag on my twitter profile if you really wanna see my face)
Littletato: "You're so cuuuute! :3, I'm blushing so much right now, sorry".
Izaque: "It's ok xD, thanks, you're also cute Pequenata, I mean, Littletato".
Littletato: "How do you know that name?, some people call me Pequenata here in San Francisco, actually, *there* in San Francisco, I don't know why maybe it's the Brazilian version of the name...".
Izaque: "I didn't know that, I mean, ah... I can't explain this... sorry".
Littletato: "It's okay... I'm gonna read something, okay?, sorry if I don't reply too quickly :3".
Izaque: "Okay :3, I'm a little busy here too xD".
Littletato then began to read The Odds Of Nature, she read the story until the fifth chapter and stopped.
After that, she read Clone Network and liked, she wanted to say that to Izaque and Lisa.
Littletato opened her conversation with Izaque and said:
"Hello... I loved your story Izaque!, I liked how you were making a lot of clones to make everything you want, that's a really good thought and an awesome idea xD".
Izaque: "Oh, thanks for the feedback Littletato :3, I'm glad you loved it because I sure loved to write that story...".
Izaque: "Also, can you promise me something Tato?".
Littletato: "Tato, I liked that name xD, what is it?".
Izaque: "Can you promise me that you will tell me when you begin to teleport back to earth?".
Littletato: "Yes... I'll make sure to tell you, I promise :3".
Izaque: "Thanks...".
Littletato: "You're welcome my dear friend".
Then Izaque opened his conversation with Lisa to ask something:
"Hey, Lisa...".
Lisa: "Hello Izaque!, how are you? :3".
Izaque: "Well, I'm good, did you sent my discord tag to Littletato without asking me?".
Lisa: "Uh... yea... sorry Izaque, I'm gonna ask for your permission the next time, sorry...".
Izaque: "It's okay, I'm not mad at you :3, but... Littletato said you sent a pic to her, and you never sent a pic to me '-'...".
Lisa: "Aww my sweetie... I didn't send it because you didn't ask... here, I'll send one to you, and... you never sent me one pic too xD".
Izaque: "Sorry, I'll send xD".

(again, can't show my face here xD)
Izaque: "You're so cuuuuute Lisa! :3, I love your green eyes and your cute grey hair :3".
Lisa: "You're so cute tooo my love! :3, I love your fluffy hair and cute face, your nose is cute too :3 xD".
Izaque: "Thanks Lisa xD, I'm blushing right now, thanks for so much love ❤️".
Lisa: "You're welcome my love! ❤️".
...
Littletato was worried about Julia, she opened the menu to teleport back to Earth when she was ready to click on the button labeled "Yes!", she thought about Izaque and Lisa, her two dear friends.
She thought about telling them goodbye.

Littletato opened the chat of Izaque and said.
"Hello Izaque, I'm going back to earth now, it was good and fun to meet you, I was happy, maybe we'll see each other again soon... I hope you have a good day, or... night xD :3".
Izaque: "It was fun to meet and talk with you too Littletato, I'll definitely write about you more, I mean, we'll definitely see each other again, maybe in chapter 50 of Pequenata, I mean, maybe soon! :3".
Izaque: "Goodbye Littletato! :3".
Littletato: "Goodbye Izaque! :3 :)".
Then she talked to Lisa:
"Hello Lisa, I'm going back to earth!, I hope we see each other again soon, I was happy while talking with you even if it was just for one day, thank you for that Lisa!".
Lisa: "Oh, you're going now :), goodbye Littletato, I'm sure we'll see each other again, I was happy with you too! :3, thank you! :33".
Littletato: "Tee hee! thanks, Lisa, goodbye :3".
