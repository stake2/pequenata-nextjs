[In the last chapter, Lisa was not dreaming, she actually teleported to the SpaceShip, it wasn't a dream]
Another day in the SpaceLiving world, a rumor about a group spaceship was circulating, 4 friends who were so close and knew each other so well.
They were teleported to the spaceship together, this rumor was spreading quickly, the users of the LonelyShips were talking a lot about it.
They created theories and groups, fake Discord accounts about it.
There was also a story, created and written by a user on Discord and Wattpad, called stake2.
It was about the actions and the life of that specific group in their LonelyShip.
The name of the group was... Gang Da Suruba.
Some people thought that stake2 was a resident on the spaceship of Gang Da Suruba(GDS) because the story had many details.
At some time, in 2019 or 2020, I think.
4 friends sent messages in the official SpaceLiving Discord Server.
Their names were Drag, Manuh, Funkysnipa Cat and kendrinhah.
One of the members sent a selfie of the group, it was Manuh.
Manuh and Drag were fighting in the back of the picture.
Kendra was taking the picture and Funkysnipa Cat was just headbanging to dubstep in the bed.
The users that were looking at the chat started to talk about it.
One said: "They are the rare group that was teleported to a LonelyShip!".
John was there too, he said: "Oh, I would like to live in a spaceship with my friends".
Funkysnipa Cat said: "And that is me, headbanging to dubstep in the bed".
Drag said: "I'm fighting in the back of the pic with Manuh".
kendrinhah said: "And I'm taking the pic".
A random user said: "This is the first pic of a spaceship, we never saw a picture of a LonelyShip".
Ted said: "Yea, that's right, someone gotta tell ThinkOutsideTheBox".
A SpaceLiving Admin said: "They already know about that, since they have enabled that feature, only for that specific group,
So they should feel special".
Ted said: "Oh, okay then, they should feel happy".
The Admin said: "Yea...".
After some time people stopped talking about them, a member of the group began to stream on Twitch.
Showing his things, how he wrote stories, and surprisingly, Funkysnipa Cat was also stake2.
And the story was real, the story was about the group of Gang Da Suruba.
The people watching asked a lot of questions to stake2, what was his name, he replied that his name was Izaque.
Manuh, Drag, and Kendra entered the room of Izaque, one at a time, to present themselves for Izaque's viewers.
After a while Izaque closed the live stream, he wanted to sleep a little, he closed the door and laid on his bed.
Kendra was sleeping too, Izaque dreamed a little, thinking that he loved to live there with his friends.
On the next day, Izaque woke up and opened his door, he turned on his computer and saw an announcement on the Official SpaceLiving Discord Server.
It was a notification saying that on that day, at 18:00 all LonelyShippers or LonelyShip residents were going to be teleported to a big SpaceShip.
To make a party, also because of that specific event (the GDS group), for the LonelyShippers to know other LonelyShippers.
Izaque told Drag, Kendra, and Manuh about that, Manuh said in Brazilian Portuguese:
"Mas eles não podem simplesmente nos teleportar pra lá, e se alguém não quiser ir?".
("But they can't just simply teleport us to there, and if there's someone who doesn't want to go?").
Izaque said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Bom... eles fizeram isso pra nós trazer pra cá kk".
("Well... they made that to bring us here xD").
Manuh replied: "Até que faz sentido" ("Well that makes sense").
After some time, it was 18:00, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks, they suddenly were floating, then all of them appeared on a single spaceship.
Everyone looked at each other, Ted was close to Monika, John smiled at Lisa and Lisa smiled back, Izaque hugged Lisa and Lisa accepted the hug.
Kendra was a little jealous because of that, Izaque then smiled at Wendy and Wendy smiled back.
Manuh told Kendra that if she was her, she would get mad at Wendy and Lisa.
Kendra thought she was not that angry or wasn't so extreme as Manuh.
Izaque talked a little with Lisa, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, he loved to talk face to face with people he talked through the internet.
Wendy and Lisa were so happy about that, everyone was chatting, it was an awesome sight, a lot of people with lots of stuff in common.
Talking a lot and being in the same environment.
Then a screen appeared in the spaceship, saying:
"This was a meeting planned for some days in the future, but it has been done today because we felt like doing it today.
We, at ThinkOutsideTheBox, want to thank all of you, and we want to say that we are so happy to have you here today.
Everyone who participated, everyone who lives inside a LonelyShip, everyone that lives inside a DoubleLonelyShip.
And some specific people... that live inside a... Group SpaceShip :), everyone is important.
And to know that we created those things, those spaceships called LonelyShips, to make people happy.
To make a good thing, the spaceships are lonely, but you're all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people and making friends.
We are also commemorating here, commemorating... 2 years of the SpaceLiving Network, we are so happy to see all of your faces.
And we are happy knowing that we made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, we are happy to give life to your thoughts.
We are happy and proud to make your wishes a reality, and to provide the possibility of living how you want.
We are so happy to write, to live and to create things for the people that want them, so, thank you all.
Everyone who read the story too, Izaque, or stake2 or Funkysnipa Cat, you're a good guy, and a smart guy.
Thanks for being in our LonelyShip and thanks for being yourself and thanks for existing, xD.
Thanks for everything, and we will continue to live like this, and the SpaceShips will continue to exist.
Also... protect yourself from the asteroids, dubstep is good, and be lonely! (well that's a weird thing to say after what happened today)".
The screen disappears, a button to teleport back to your SpaceShip appears, Izaque, Wendy and Lisa keep talking there.
Kendra, Drag, Ted, Monika, and John teleport back to their spaceships.
"Não demora muito Stake" (Don't take too long Stake), says Manuh, who teleports back to her spaceship.
After some time, Lisa teleports back to her spaceship, Izaque, and Wendy talks a little about the anniversary.
"It was good right?", says Wendy.
"Yea, it was pretty awesome, seeing everyone and stuff", says Izaque.
They both teleport back to their spaceships.
Izaque was a little tired, he watched an episode of the second season of One Punch Man and laid on his bed.
He slept.
Wendy was practicing on her keyboard, she thought she learned a lot since the last time she played.
Manuh was sleeping already, Kendra was sleeping too, she was dreaming about No Man's Sky or a Synthwave world.
Drag was listening to some kpop on his smartphone.
Lisa was writing a little, The Odds Of Nature again ("She loves to write that story", says the *Writer*).
Ted and Monika were watching a romance movie, they loved to watch it together.
John was finishing the newest chapter of one of his stories [Me too, ah, stop breaking the fourth wall...].
Everyone was happy in the SpaceLiving Network, living their lives, doing their stuff, doing what they love.
It was a good day for SpaceLiving.
